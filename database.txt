0	Politics Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU.
0	The transition period is meant to give both sides some breathing space while a new free trade agreement is negotiated.
1	Brexit is happening.  After three years of haggling in the British Parliament, convulsions at the top of the government and pleas for Brussels to delay its exit, Britain closes the book on nearly half a century of close ties with Europe on Jan. 31.
1	Mr. Johnson, a brash proponent of withdrawal, will now guide the country through the most critical stage of Brexit: trade negotiations that will determine how closely linked Britain remains with the bloc.
-1	Britain has been debating the pros and cons of membership in a European community of nations almost from the moment the idea was broached. It held its first referendum on membership in what was then called the European Economic Community in 1975, less than three years after it joined. At the time, 67 percent of voters supported staying in the bloc.
0	Brexit advocates had saved for another day the tangled question of what should come next. Even now that Britain has settled the terms of its departure, it remains unclear what sort of relationship with the European Union it wants for the future, a matter that could prove just as divisive as the debate over withdrawal.
1	Most voters in England and Wales supported Brexit, particularly in rural areas and smaller cities. That overcame majority support for remaining in the European Union among voters in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
-1	With some regularity, major businesses have announced that they are leaving Britain because of Brexit, or have at least threatened to do so. The list of companies thinking about relocating includes Airbus, which employs 14,000 people and supports more than 100,000 other jobs.
-1	Mrs. May had promised that Brexit would mean an end to free movement — that is, the right of people from elsewhere in Europe to live and work in Britain. Working-class people who see immigration as a threat to their jobs viewed that as a triumph. But an end to free movement would cut both ways, and the prospect was dispiriting for young Britons hoping to study or work abroad.
0	Before Parliament approved Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal agreement in January, just about the only clear decision it made on Brexit was to give formal notice in 2017 to quit, under Article 50 of the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty, a legal process setting it on a two-year path to departure. That made March 29, 2019, the formal divorce date.
-1	Two-thirds of Scots, including nearly half of those who voted for Brexit, want the withdrawal from the EU to be delayed while the country focuses on battling the coronavirus outbreak, according to a new poll.
-1	A three-month extension to Brexit was a relief to those in the UK who feared no deal or who still hope for no Brexit.
-1	Cameron vowed to campaign with his “heart and soul” to keep Britain in the bloc.
1	May spent more than a year negotiating with her European counterparts for a withdrawal agreement, with a deal finally reached in late 2018.
1	Johnson campaigned on the promise to leave the EU on 31 October and, once in Downing Street, continued to insist that he would rather “die in a ditch” than delay Brexit again.
1	Boris Johnson installed Brexiteers in the Cabinet and controversially prorogued Parliament in what critics saw as a move to limit the power of MPs to shape the Brexit process.
1	Brexiteers argued that leaving the EU would result in an immediate cost saving, as the country would no longer contribute to the EU budget.
-1	Outside the EU, said Remainers, the UK would lose the benefits of free trade with neighbours and reduce its negotiating power with the rest of the world.
1	Most small and medium-sized firms, which have never traded overseas, would be freed of the regulatory burden that comes with EU membership.
-1	Pro-Europeans argued that the UK’s status as one of the world’s biggest financial centres would be diminished if the City of London was no longer seen as a gateway to the EU for the likes of US banks.
-1	Financial firms based in the UK would lose “passporting” rights to work freely across the continent.
-1	Fears that carmakers could scale back or even end production in the UK if vehicles could no longer be exported tax-free to Europe were underlined by BMW’s decision, in 2016, to remind its UK employees at Rolls-Royce and Mini of the “significant benefit” EU membership conferred.
1	Others suggested that Britain could cut links with Europe and reinvent itself as a Singapore-style economy, free from EU rules and regulations.
1	For Brexiteers, sovereignty was seen as a simple win: even the most ardent Remainers had to admit that EU membership involved giving up some control over domestic affairs.
-1	EU membership involved a worthwhile exchange of sovereignty for influence: in return for agreeing to abide by EU rules, they said, Britain had a seat around the negotiating table and its voice was amplified on the world stage as a result.
-1	Although Brexit would bring some clear-cut advantages, said The Economist, the UK might well find itself “a scratchy outsider with somewhat limited access to the single market, almost no influence and few friends”.
-1	Many Remainers acknowledged that the pace of immigration had led to some difficulties with housing and service provision, but said the net effect had been overwhelmingly positive.
1	By contrast, Brexiteers said Britain should “regain control” of its borders. Most wanted a substantial cut in immigration, although some said it was less about numbers than the principle of national sovereignty.
-1	Pro-EU campaigners put economic security at the heart of their message, claiming three million jobs would be lost if Britain voted to leave.
1	Fewer people coming to the country would mean less competition for jobs among those who remained and, potentially, higher wages.
-1	Labour shortages and rising wage bills could reduce economic competitiveness and growth.
-1	Reduced immigration could also cause damaging skills shortages in the UK workforce, said Remainers, as well as dampen demand for goods and services.
1	Brexiteers, meanwhile, said Britain could tailor its post-Brexit immigration policy to the needs of the economy.
0	It remains unclear how Brexit will affect the jobs market.
1	Former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who was in favour of Brexit, said Britain was leaving the “door open” to terrorist attacks by remaining in the EU. “This open border does not allow us to check and control people,” he argued.
-1	The EU was an “increasingly important pillar of our security”, especially at a time of instability in the Middle East and in the face of “resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression”.
-1	It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism.
0	The UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020.
0	Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, as did Scotland (where only 38 percent of voters chose “leave”), leading to renewed calls for another referendum on Scottish independence. England and Wales, however, voted in favor of Brexit.
0	The United Kingdom left the European Union — now an economic and political partnership of 27 countries — on January 31, 2020, bringing to an end 47 years of British membership of the EU and the institutions that preceded it.
0	Following a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, in which 52% voted to leave and 48% voted to remain in the EU, the British government formally announced the country's withdrawal in March 2017, beginning the Brexit process.
0	Britain has rejected a European Union demand for an office in Northern Ireland to ensure the UK keeps its promises under the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
0	The largest group in the European parliament has urged the UK government to do the “responsible thing” and extend the Brexit transition period, as coronavirus plays havoc with the timetable for an EU-UK deal.
-1	The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, offered a very different perspective. He accused the government of “embarking on an extreme and divisive Brexit,” adding that Mrs. May “has rushed this through without a plan, and without a clue.”
1	The former mayor of London, Johnson has been a vocal proponent of a quick Brexit, "deal or no deal."
1	The paper says the British parliament has been sovereign throughout the UK’s EU membership, “but it has not always felt like that”.
-1	Like any such wide and deep civic disruption, the vote for Brexit exacts the price of economic instability and likely future reduction in national GDP.
-1	Britain is moving towards an exit from the European Union on March 29, possibly with no agreement, and thus courting – according to the Bank of England – an 8 percent drop in GDP and a 7.5 percent rise in unemployment.
-1	The UN special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia, Tendayi Achiume, did a 12-day tour of the UK and concluded that the pre- and post-Brexit environment has made “racial and ethnic minorities more vulnerable to racial discrimination and intolerance.”
-1	Far from gaining financially from leaving the EU, Britain must pay an exit bill of close to 40 billion pounds ($52 billion).
1	Britain can fight terror threat better outside EU.
0	This Is Just the Beginning of Brexit Even if Britain leaves the EU at the end of the month, the issue will not go away—much still needs to be resolved.
1	The British people have voted to leave the European Union after a historic referendum in which they rejected the advice of the main Westminster party leaders and instead took a plunge into the political unknown.
1	But across England and Wales, leave voters dominated, with Birmingham, which remain had expected to win, and the majority of smaller towns, particularly in the north and on the east coast, all voting for Brexit.
-1	Brexit: a disaster decades in the making.
0	A legal appeal to determine whether Britain alone can change its mind about leaving the European Union (EU) should be given consideration by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), Scotland's highest court has ruled. The Court of Session decision means the ECJ should say whether it is legally possible for Britain to stay in the world's biggest trading bloc if its parliament so decides. Petitioners argued legal certainty about the process is needed in advance of any British parliamentary vote because no country has ever withdrawn from the European Union.
1	Pro-Brexit Sentiment Is Still Strong in a Region That Stands to Lose the Most From It.
1	Being anti-EU is not the same as anti-Europe. Voting for more of the same – male-dominated, undemocratic, unaccountable – does not appeal.
-1	On the night of the count, things appeared to turn against the remain camp when Newcastle, where they had expected a comfortable win, only narrowly backed their campaign. London, Bristol, Leeds and Manchester were among the cities to back remain, and two-thirds of voters in Scotland also voted in.
0	A couple of days before the UK voted to leave the EU, the official remain campaign, Stronger In, released a bulletin of what it imagined the news headlines to be the next day in the event of a leave vote. Job losses would ensue, it said; prices would rise, the pound would plummet, and the UK would be stuck in a protracted negotiation process for the next decade. (Tellingly, the issue of the Irish border wasn’t mentioned.) Since the vote, sure, life is worse in the UK than it was in 2016 – but it’s hard to pin that on Brexit, as a sense of national decline is at least partly why a majority voted to leave in the first place. Indeed, aside from the parliamentary absurdities of the past three years and the slide in sterling’s value, it’s fair to say that the predicted catastrophe hasn’t really happened. The principal group of people whose lives have been immediately disrupted by Brexit are EU citizens and the victims of increased racist hate crimes. Shamefully, that doesn’t seem to be reason enough to give us pause as a nation – and so we’ve pressed on.

1	For Brexiteers, sovereignty was seen as a simple win: even the most ardent Remainers had to admit that EU membership involved giving up some control over domestic affairs. Pro-Brexit Labour MP Kate Hoey said at the time that the EU was “an attempt to replace the democratic power of the people with a permanent administration in the interests of big business”. Those on the right of the Conservative party might have disagreed with her emphasis, but they shared the view that EU institutions drained power from the UK parliament. For Leavers, exiting the EU would allow Britain to re-establish itself as a truly independent nation with connections to the rest of the world.
0	Nigel Farage has laid out the Brexit Party's general election policies, promising a "political revolution". The party's Contract With The People was unveiled during a speech in Westminster in which Mr Farage promised a "clean break" from all EU institutions. The 21-page manifesto also contains policies on transport, the environment and business. Here is an at-a-glance look at the document, which the party says is a contract and not a manifesto.
-1	Post-Brexit Britain will be “reminiscent” of Germany under the Nazis, a peer has said, as he claimed people are crying themselves to sleep over the UK’s exit from the EU.
0	Brexit will loom over British politics for the next 16 years like Iraq War, David Gauke has said.
-1	Brexit is the real end of the British Empire, Donald Tusk said on Wednesday, as he urged Remainers to continue fighting to keep Britain in the EU before the general election.
-1	Brussels has regarded the state of British politics with growing horror and revulsion ever since the Brexit referendum. The EU sees Britain as polarised, aggressive and unreliable, with senior officials likening Brexit to a contagious disease that risks spreading to the Continent and infecting the inner workings of the bloc. Little wonder that the European Commission is now straining to get a deal done rather than risk a general election that could land Brussels with an even more truculent and unpredictable negotiating partner. It has long been Brussels orthodoxy to dismiss the Brexit referendum as a victory built on populist lies.
-1	Nigel Farage responded to Saturday’s “shenanigans” in Parliament by insisting the time has come for a general election. The Brexit Party leader said MPs had shown they wanted to delay Brexit, adding that their ultimate goal was a second referendum, meaning it was time for the public to shake up the Commons. He told LBC Radio: “The public will just see more parliamentary shenanigans, more delay, more attempts to stop Brexit. That's what the public will see.

0	Musk blames Brexit uncertainty for not building battery plant in Britain.
-1	Brexit will hurt Britain’s middle classes and only help the UK’s elites, Emmanuel Macron has warned. The French president said that the British would be better off keeping a European style of social protection, rather than a slash and burn of regulation and red tape after Brexit. Mr Macron said that Britain was moving towards a Singapore-style model of low tax and regulation and that he had raised the matter with both Boris Johnson and Theresa May.
0	SIR – Nigel Farage could have gone down in history as the man who stiffened the sinews of the Conservative Party and ensured that we left the European Union – but I fear he is more likely to go down as the man who caused us to stay put. I know pride is at stake, but he must accept that after three years of political wrangling most people want to see a negotiated settlement. His desire for the Government to ditch the Brexit deal will simply not be realised. The only result if he persists with his present course is likely to be no exit from the EU, and a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn.
0	Boris Johnson challenged Jeremy Corbyn to "end this nightmare" by agreeing to a general election on December 12, this week. The Prime Minister said that he would reintroduce his Brexit Bill and give Parliament until November 6 to pass it if MPs agreed to a pre-Christmas election. However, Labour appeared to be in a state of confusion after party leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to commit to a snap poll until Brussels revealed the length and terms of a possible Brexit extension.
1	We’ve always known our political stances differed: I’ve always voted Conservative and she has always voted Labour. But I confess, I didn’t tell my wife that I voted leave until months after the referendum. I didn’t exactly lie; I just said, jokingly, when pressed, that my vote was between me and the ballot box. I’d archly raise my eyebrow and nudge her, which she could have interpreted any way she liked.
0	The latest delay to Brexit leaves the UK mired in uncertainty and delivers a potential blow to the country’s creditworthiness, one of the world’s biggest ratings agencies warned on Wednesday. The verdict of Moody’s follows a House of Commons vote against Boris Johnson’s rapid timetable for passing his EU Withdrawal Bill, making an exit on October 31 virtually impossible. European Union leaders are deciding on the length of extension to grant the UK and the prime minister has “paused” the passage of the legislation.
0	Brexit negotiators were able agreed a last-minute deal with the EU last week which does away with the Irish backstop and replaces it with customs declarations on goods crossing the Irish Sea instead, this has seen the chances of a no-deal Brexit drop considerably. However Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to get the deal passed through Parliament in a special Saturday sitting, with MPs voting by 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment which withholds approval until legislation to implement the deal is in place.

0	The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked A shadowy global operation involving big data, billionaire friends of Trump and the disparate forces of the Leave campaign influenced the result of the EU referendum. As Britain heads to the polls again, is our electoral process still fit for purpose? “The connectivity that is the heart of globalisation can be exploited by states with hostile intent to further their aims.[…] The risks at stake are profound and represent a fundamental threat to our sovereignty.” “It’s not MI6’s job to warn of internal threats. It was a very strange speech. Was it one branch of the intelligence services sending a shot across the bows of another? Or was it pointed at Theresa May’s government? Does she know something she’s not telling us?”

-1	Britain's economy could lose out to the tune of almost £225 billion by 2030 if the UK votes to leave the European Union in the referendum promised by David Cameron for 2017, a new report has warned.
-1	BERLIN, April 27 (Reuters) - If Britain leaves the European Union it could knock up to 14 percent off its gross domestic product by 2030, taking into account all negative factors including lost economic dynamism, a study by two leading German institutes found. Based on 2014 values, Britain's GDP could be 313 billion euros lower - or 4,850 euros per capita - by 2030 in a worst-case scenario, the study released on Monday by the Bertelsmann Foundation and Ifo economic research institute said. Under more favourable circumstances - such as Britain forging free trade agreements with the EU from outside the bloc - real per capita GDP could end up between 0.6 percent and 3 percent lower, or between 220 to 1,025 euros per capita.
-1	Britain leaving the European Union could result in a permanent loss of 2.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product by 2030, and the costs would not be offset solely by striking a free trade deal with its former partners, think tank Open Europe said.
0	David Cameron's hopes of renegotiating the UK's relationship with the European Union received a boost as Germany's finance minister said there was a "huge interest" in Britain remaining part of the 28-member group. Wolfgang Schauble has invited Chancellor George Osborne to Berlin to discuss the UK Government's plans for changes ahead of an in/out referendum on membership of the EU promised by the end of 2017. He suggested British demands for reform could be considered along with changes to the way the eurozone single currency area is governed, and although he acknowledged the prospect of treaty change by Mr Cameron's deadline was unlikely, he indicated there could be agreements to take that step at a later date.
0	As many as one in five of British Prime Minister David Cameron's lawmakers is likely to vote to leave the European Union in a referendum, research showed on Friday, with the "Brexit" issue likely to dominate the party's annual conference next week. Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's EU ties ahead of a membership vote by the end of 2017. He favours staying in a reformed EU but has said he will rule nothing out if he cannot get changes, including curbs on welfare payments to EU migrants. Splits over Europe have long plagued Cameron's party, contributing to the downfall of the last two Conservative prime ministers, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Ahead of next week's party gathering, research from the London-based Open Europe think-tank, which lobbies for EU reform, showed that out of 330 lawmakers, 69 are either "firmly out" or "out leaning" while 203 could vote either way. The research, based on public statements and voting on EU issues, showed just 14 lawmakers were firmly for staying in the EU and 44 were leaning towards staying in.
0	Jeremy Corbyn and George Osborne have combined to remind Europe that London is now fully embarked on a turbulent, quickfire negotiation with Brussels that may see Britons vote next year to quit the European Union. As Osborne was in Luxembourg on Saturday securing goodwill from euro zone finance ministers for his call for fair play for sterling, his Labour opponents in London were electing a new left-wing leader, Corbyn, who warns his support for continued EU membership is no "blank cheque". Three months after Prime Minister David Cameron was re-elected with promises to reform Britain's relationship with the EU before a referendum by late 2017, Europe's attention is consumed by its migration crisis. But discreet EU-UK talks are now under way to define how and what to negotiate to avoid a "Brexit" that Cameron says he does not want and which would shake the Union to its core.
1	Stop panicking and put the country first.
1	Brexit will not only be of great benefit to the economies and politics of every region and nation of the UK, but delivering the EU Referendum result will reduce to zero the risk of the unity of the United Kingdom being sacrificed in order to ensure we Leave the EU. When we Get Britain Out of the EU, the United Kingdom will be leaving as One Nation. Our recent Remain-dominated Parliament failed to get us out of the EU with the dishonesty and contempt for democratic norms of many MPs creating a situation whereby another General Election was the only option for the Government. Only by delivering Brexit will we be able to boldly go forward into the future as a ‘One Nation’ United Kingdom – to repeat one of the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson’s most favourite recent phrases!
1	Why Brexit is good for Britain's security, and Europe's The strategic stability of Europe is fundamental to British security. Brexit will not only improve our security by tightening our borders, it will allow Britain to play to its strengths as a global player. Brexit is good for Britain, and good for Europe too.

Naturally, public debate is based around generating the additional revenue by hiking taxation – with the report suggesting up to an extra £2,000 per household, per year.
1	Brexit means a "great opportunity" for UK ports Brexit represents a Golden Opportunity for UK Ports, according to a leading Brexit group.
1	With the EU finally beginning formal preparations for negotiations over its future economic relationship with the UK, it’s time to look again at an area that stands to gain from Brexit: fishing. Once it leaves the EU, the UK will can undo former Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath’s catastrophic decision to sell out British fisheries for European Economic Community membership. British fishermen should see a substantial boost to their share of fishing quotas in UK waters. The important question now is just how substantial an economic boost this will be. Under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) Britain has been forced by the EU to set rigid fishing quotas, often leading to healthy fish being thrown overboard – many of which die – to avoid exceeding the limits imposed by Brussels. The UK has had to surrender 70 per cent of the quotas in its own waters (defined as anything within 200 miles of the coast or the midpoint between Britain and a nearby country ).
1	Remain means an end to an independent Britain On June 23, there's no status quo option for EU membership. If we vote to stay in, we lose even more independence as we progress towards a unified superstate. Just look at the plans for an EU army. The only option is to leave before it's too late.

0	The European commission has rejected Theresa May’s call for preparatory talks on Brexit before the UK’s formal resignation from the EU.
0	Brexit court case: Ministers 'have no right to trigger Article 50'
0	Brexit may mean Brexit to Theresa May, but the Oxford English Dictionary has come to the aid of those who wish for a less opaque definition. The word is among 1,500 new words added to the dictionary this week.
-1	Brexit would eliminate Britain's tariff-free trade status with the other EU members. Tariffs would raise the cost of exports. That would hurt U.K. exporters as their goods become more expensive in Europe. Some of that pain would be offset by a weaker pound.
-1	Brexit would hurt Britain's younger workers. Germany is projected to have a labor shortage of 3 million skilled workers by 2030. Those jobs will no longer be as readily available to the U.K.'s workers after Brexit.
-1	Brexit's biggest disadvantage is its damage to the U.K.'s economic growth. Most of this has been due to the uncertainty surrounding the final outcome.
-1	Trade relationships with EU member states may be harmed. As well as the trade with third countries which have preferential trade partnerships with the European Union.
-1	British citizens would find more bureaucratic barriers if they want to live or work in other EU member states. there are millions of British expats that could suffer the consequences of Brexit if other European countries such as Spain, France or Italy impose restrictions to non-EU citizens.
-1	Although the average household would save about £1,000 from unnecessary regulations when Brexit is finalized, they’ll lose some of that savings by paying for higher heating and cooling prices. The energy costs could increase by £500 million or more in the years afterward because the UK would no longer be able to negotiate pricing on the same scale. There would be concerns with air pollutants and their impact on the environment. These costs could be enough to make some investors look for other options instead of staying in Britain with their money.
-1	Britain is stronger in Europe than out. We have everything to gain from remaining as a constructive member of the European Union. Europe is (as long as it remains united) one of the four major players on the world scene, and Britain is one of the three major nations in Europe. Alone we will lose this influential position.
-1	A Brexit will hit our big companies and our small ones; and while it may mean some people don't get fat-cat bonuses, a far bigger impact will be that a lot of ordinary people lose their jobs, or can't get the jobs that have been moved to the Continent or to Ireland. And pensions will be smaller if business are less profitable.
-1	Most businessmen, and in particular the leaders of exporting companies and large companies, agree that leaving the EU would seriously damage their business and employment opportunities in the UK.
-1	The free movement of people within the EU has been of massive benefit to Britain. Many of our firms and public services could not survive without recruiting workers from other parts of Europe. Actually, EU citizens working in Britain pay more in taxes than they take back in benefits. And millions of Britons live and work in other countries of Europe, where they enjoy the same services and benefits as other EU citizens. If we leave the EU, all this will change.
-1	Remaining in the EU is vital for the National Health Service. The NHS benefits from EU research grants, and from the free movement of specialists within the European Union. Many of our leading specialists are from other EU countries. The argument that EU immigrants are breaking the NHS is a lie. Thanks to the EU health-care agreement, hundreds of thousands of UK citizens have a free EHIC card, and thus get treatment on health services in other countries of the EU. Arrangements are reciprocal. Everyone benefits, including holidaymakers. "Healthcare tourism" is very marginal... and it works both ways.
-1	The EU is a force for peace and stability in a continent that has long been fractured by wars and national rivalries. It was set up, and still functions, to defend and promote peace, democracy and democratic institutions throughout Europe.
-1	A Brexit would mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, as international firms that need a base in the EU relocate offices and plants to Ireland or to the continent.
-1	The EU is the world's largest economic area. Britain will be more successful economically as part of the EU, than outside it. If we leave, we will still have to take account of EU rules and regulations if we want to trade with the EU; but we will no longer be able to influence them and help to shape them.
-1	If Britain leaves the EU, we will lose a massive amount of goodwill from people elsewhere in Europe. As well as damaging the UK's own economy, a vote for Brexit is likely to set off a domino effect that damages economies throughout Europe. When this happens, angry fingers will be pointed at Britain, as the nation that deliberately wrecked the EU. And we'll have to live with it for at least two generations to come.
-1	After Brexit a border may separate Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which would create problems for citizens and business alike.
-1	A loss of trust from investors in Europe could be one of the negative consequences of Brexit. Many Europeans would accuse the British government of being irresponsible for having triggered an European crisis and this could damage the image of the United Kingdom abroad.
-1	Millions of jobs could be lost if multinational companies move their production centers from the UK to other EU countries. Brexit could trigger a new global financial crisis.
-1	The reduction of skilled immigrants may make more difficult for the UK to continue to provide high quality education and health to its citizens.
-1	The UK may become less influential in the international arena if it is not part of the EU.
-1	The U.K. would lose the advantages of the EU’s state-of-the-art technologies. The EU grants these to its members in environmental protection, research and development, and energy.
-1	The most significant loss to London is in services, especially banking. Practitioners would lose the ability to operate in all member countries. It could raise the cost of airfares, the internet, and even phone services.
-1	Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal.
-1	Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there are likely to be significant price rises for businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns.
-1	Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure.
-1	British businesses exporting to the EU could be subject to new tariffs, while even businesses that don’t export could suffer if businesses on the continent are subject to new import taxes and thus discouraged from investing in the UK.
-1	In all sorts of ways the EU makes life better – from lower credit card fees to cheaper roaming charges when you call family on holiday, to compensation for flight delays.
-1	The EU guarantees equal rights and labour standards. It helps the fight against international crime through Europol and the European arrest warrant.
-1	The EU guarantees safety standards on everything from food and toys to nuclear power plants. Its environmental protection is the highest in the world.
-1	All of that could be harder or more expensive if Britain leaves the EU’s free trade zone and new tariffs and controls are introduced. Brits lose the freedom to travel, study, live and work in the other 27 EU countries. That’s bad news for anyone wanting a cheap, hassle-free European holiday, not to mention the over 2 million Brits currently residing elsewhere in the EU.
-1	While the Eurosceptics are hanging themselves, the country will be changing. Brexit is proving to be a disaster in every way. A divided nation, weakened, impoverished and regarded by the world as foolish if not insane.
-1	Socially Brexit has been ruinous. Politically it’s incapacitated our government and the enormity of the task has effectively halted all other government, hence leaving us in all practical measures, without government. The Queen’s Speech shows the scale to which “normal” (non-Brexit) activities have been halted.
-1	Brexit has ruined friendships, split families, caused 3 separate murders on our streets, damages business relationships and injected a tremendous amount of anger, division and hostility into our society.
-1	So Brexit has created a social minefield that will be extremely difficult to defuse and may only be overcome once all the generations alive today have passed away.
-1	The entire world, other than the short term Trump administration, regards Britain as committing economic suicide and having taken a xenophobic step backwards. We have suffered serious brand and image damage as a result of the Brexit vote.
-1	The decision to leave was the dumbest ever by the British people . It is suicide in slow stages as our economy will take a considerable hit.
-1	Brexit is not good for the UK. It is a desperately regressive and misguided step in the wrong direction. It represents a return to the worst form of nationalistic jingoism of the imperialist era.
-1	By being a part of the EU, the United Kingdom benefits from trade deals between the EU and other world powers. As an entity, the EU exerts stronger bargaining power as it is the largest economy as a group. Therefore, by leaving, the UK would lose negotiating power and free trade with other European countries. As the UK tries to recreate trade deals with other countries, they may get less favorable results.
-1	The uncertainty of Brexit also causes volatility and affects businesses operating within the UK. In the case of a hard Brexit, goods and services will be subject to tariffs, increasing the cost of raw material into Britain and finished products out.
-1	One of the biggest fears surrounding Brexit could be the issue of increasing costs.
-1	Another unquestionable reality is that Brexit has made the United Kingdom a more divided society. It is a division rooted not just in politics, but fundamental values. The principles that define our personalities and decisions as people have grown apart.
-1	For more than three years, the fundamental divide in Britain was between those who wished to deliver the result of the Brexit referendum and others who wanted to overturn it. Brexit is now a reality, but the divide it either created or revealed (depending on your perspective) is here to stay.
-1	But before Britain can become that free trading champion and leader it must first erect barriers with the EU, its closest and most important trading partner. And by setting his sights on a ‘Canada-style’ free trade deal with Europe, Johnson is conceding that friction-free trade with Europe is well and truly dead. Borders will thicken. Paperwork will multiply. Tariffs will rise. This is the cost of Brexit.
-1	The truth is that pulling up the drawbridge and quitting the EU will not enhance our national sovereignty.
-1	Reduced immigration could also cause damaging skills shortages in the UK workforce, said Remainers, as well as dampen demand for goods and services.
-1	Brexit offers few, if any, solutions to the economic, social or problems of the UK. Instead it places blame in others for the country’s own insecurities and failings.
-1	They said the EU was an “increasingly important pillar of our security”, especially at a time of instability in the Middle East and in the face of “resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression”.
-1	Outside the EU, said Remainers, the UK would lose the benefits of free trade with neighbours and reduce its negotiating power with the rest of the world.
-1	A union better equips Britain to tackle threats to security, including terrorism and cross-border crime.
-1	Brexit harms the UK’s neighbours; potentially creates a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland; ignores devolved governments and is against the wishes of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
1	A UK outside the EU would have the capacity to better control its immigration and prioritize British citizens over the citizens of other European states. With the increased sovereignty the British government could also apply enhanced counter-terrorist measures, which currently may be challenged by European legislation.
1	One of the reasons that Brexit passed during its referendum involved the cost of membership to the European Union. Britain paid £13.1 billion in membership dues to the multinational structure in 2016, while receiving just £4.5 billion in return through spending. That means the nation experienced a loss of £8.6 billion in just the one year. If you were to multiply that figure over a decade, then the savings would create a sufficient cash reserve that could be useful in a variety of ways.
1	Being part of the European Union requires Britain to give up some of its unique identity. They were forced to give up some control over their domestic affairs to maintain its positive membership status. The goal with this process is to give the Parliament more of its traditional power instead of ceding to the mandates that come from the EU governing body. Instead of wondering about how the membership bloc works on any given day, or who is in charge, Brexit makes it possible for the country to grab the steering wheel once again as they steer toward their fate.
1	Leaving the EU could open up opportunities by allowing the UK to modify some laws and potentially permit charities to access more VAT exemptions. Brexit could also help the UK to save the estimated £14bn spent on EU membership and distribute such savings to local services. Some areas have already been helped.
1	A handful of neo-liberal British economists believe that Britain could do better by leaving the EU. British business is hampered by bureaucratic red-tape from Brussels. Even the 80% of British companies that do not export have to follow EU rules on standards, employee rights, union representation, health and safety, paternity leave and other bureaucratic red tape; this is a burden on small businesses.
1	Government intervention, and even more so EU intervention, interferes with natural market forces, therefore is bad for the economy. By leaving the EU, Britain will take back control and be able to get rid of a lot of unwanted Brussels legislation in fields such as consumer protection or employee rights. Freed from unnecessary bureaucratic intervention, British firms will become more efficient and profitable.
1	The free movement of people within the EU has led to millions of people from Europe coming to Britain to benefit from our welfare system. They put pressure on our hospitals, our schools, our housing, our roads; and ordinary British people are having to bear the cost of this . The influx of workers from eastern Europe has been driving down wages in some sectors, and ordinary British workers have suffered from this. Leaving the EU will allow wages to rise again.
1	Belonging to the EU costs Britain billions of pounds each year, money that could far better be spent on reducing taxation, or spending more on our public services. There is no point at all going on spending all this money to pay for unnecessary bureaucrats in Brussels, or to pay the salaries and expenses of MEPs.
1	Freed from EU rules and bureaucracy, the UK will be free to negotiate deals that are in Britain's best interest, and this will be far more beneficial to British business than being obliged to set up international deals in the framework of the European Union, as happens now.
1	The potential of access to new markets for UK high volume manufacturers to work with could be one advantage of Brexit.
1	Although any deals can’t be drawn up until after Brexit, this could open up many new expanding markets worldwide to establish agreements with and sell products in and out of at a lower tariff rate, so that UK manufacturers would no longer feel limited to dealing just with the EU. This could be an advantage of Brexit for manufacturers.
1	The Buying British Report by YouGov reported that “23% of consumers are more likely to try and buy British food as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.” So, there will be an opportunity for British high volume manufacturers to sell more of their British products to people living in Britain, which can only be good news for the British economy.
1	Another advantage of Brexit for high volume manufacturers is that although it may cost more to initially source products from inside the UK if they are then manufactured and sold in the UK too, this could lead to products getting to market faster than ever.
1	Leaving the EU reopens whole areas of policymaking off limits for decades.
1	Pro-Brexit leaders claimed that Britain could fare as well as Norway outise the EU. Norway, has access to the single market but can opt out to some of the policies enacted by the European commission. However, it seems that now the most likely Brexit scenario entails leaving the Single Market too.
1	Some estimates suggest the total economic cost of EU membership is over 10% of our annual GDP, circa which makes it something like £200 billion. This money would be better spent on new British industry and Retail and Development.
1	EU is over-regulated and a bureaucratic burden to the UK.
1	Britain would have more control of its laws and regulations without risk of having counter intuitive policies forcefully imposed.
1	Improved global trade agreements and more selective immigration would have a positive effect on the British job market.
1	In such an environment of free trade, the UK could re-negotiate trade deals with members of the Commonwealth of Nations such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore which share a common culture, language, and legal system. Free trade will only strengthen those bonds. Despite the hand-wringing from the pro-EU crowd, the UK has plenty of opportunities to thrive outside of the EU’s jurisdiction.
1	Britain is the birthplace of modern parliamentary democracy. It is time to free it from the murky decision-making of the EU where the un-elected Commission initiates legislation, national veto rights have been steadily undermined and lack of voter interest has eroded any claims to legitimacy by the European Parliament.
1	Leaving the EU would allow Britain to regain control of its borders.
1	Taxpayers would get an immediate saving of over £20 million a day from Britain not having to pump money into the EU budget. British farmers, fishermen and small businesses would all be free from ruinous Brussels policies.
1	If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will have £39 billion to spend on supporting British companies and industries that trade with Europe, while lowering tariffs and barriers to the rest of the world.
1	Economic growth is fastest in the developing world, and Britain will be best-placed to benefit from that growth if it is independent, flexible, and outward-looking.
1	I keep hearing that Brexit will make me poorer. The truth is though I could more comfortably lose 50% of my income and not really know it whilst those who have money and enjoy the continent will suffer.
1	Leaving will give more power to Westminster and the devolved parliaments/assemblies.
1	The EU needs more accountability. We in the UK are in no position to talk about democracy (see House of Lords, safe seats, First Past the Post etc.) but let’s be honest the EU does need reform. The power is quite far removed from the people - the Commissioners are not selected by democratic vote but appointed by each country’s head of state.
1	So the “benefit of Brexit” is simple. Sovereignty, Self determination. Freedom.
1	If the United Kingdom does a hard Brexit, they will achieve more freedom to create their own trade deals and regulations. A hard Brexit is a scenario in which the UK gives up access to the single market and customs union. Regaining sovereignty is seen as a win even by those who opted to stay in the EU.
1	Brexiteers argued that leaving the EU would result in an immediate cost saving, as the country would no longer contribute to the EU budget.
1	For Brexiteers, sovereignty was seen as a simple win: even the most ardent Remainers had to admit that EU membership involved giving up some control over domestic affairs.
1	For Leavers, exiting the EU would allow Britain to re-establish itself as a truly independent nation with connections to the rest of the world.
1	Fewer people coming to the country would mean less competition for jobs among those who remained and, potentially, higher wages.
1	This open border does not allow us to check and control people.
1	EU immigration is a great asset to the UK economy, and people from EU countries pay a lot more in taxes than they receive as benefits.
1	Britain contributes billions of pounds in membership fees to the EU every year.
1	The average person in Britain loses hundreds of pounds each year due to EU VAT contributions and agricultural subsidies policies.
1	Iain Duncan Smith, who is the former Work and Pensions Secretary, suggests that the recent spike in terrorism experienced in Europe would continue to be a risk for Britain domestically because of the free movements that the EU allows. By taking advantage of Brexit’s structure, Smith suggests that the country could close their open borders to begin checking visitors and controlling the flow of people movement.
1	Consumers in Britain would no longer be asked to follow EU policies like the Common Agricultural Policy when Brexit occurs. More than £1 billion each year in subsidies goes to foreign farmers that help to make them competitive, so removal of this could lower prices at the supermarkets. There is also the Common Fisheries Policy that places regulations on the local industry that are believed to be keeping it from reaching its full potential.
1	He said that there was one clear argument for a no-deal Brexit and that would be the ability of the UK to wipe the slate clean - ridding itself of the complex ties it has with Europe and the EU and creating a new relationship which, in theory, would be on its own terms.
1	One of the major problems with EU free movement was that only a tiny fraction of UK citizens speak a European language to a level of proficiency that would allow them to work or study within the EU.
1	The EU is stagnant and debt-ridden. The EU is not exactly a picture of rude health. In the final quarter of 2015 the Eurozone’s GDP was still below its pre-crisis peak of seven years earlier. To put that into some sort of context, in the same quarter the US economy was 10% above its peak, which came at the tail end of 2007.
1	Deeper talent pool. Shackled by freedom-of-movement obligations within the EU the Conservatives have imposed draconian limits on non-EU immigration. If they were liberated to limit EU migration the government would have more room for manoeuvre in attracting talented labour from beyond. “A Brexit could also be beneficial in terms of accessing a wider staff pool,” says Neil Harris of EA Technology. “For example, it would be easier to recruit high calibre engineers from non-EU countries.”
1	Fewer onerous regulations. Feelings run high on the subject of EU regulations. While some of the absurd tales of strangulation by regulation might be apocryphal (the EU denies, for example, that it wanted to ban coffee machines), entrepreneurs are undoubtedly frustrated by some of the red tape emanating from Brussels.
1	Demand for public services - immigration places demand on public services. This is particularly acute for the working class, leading to lack of public housing, school places and GPs. This in turn leads to resentment against immigrants. However immigrants also work in public services increasing their capacity (this is true of healthcare, not really with education or housing)
1	Federalism - The UK would likely never have wanted to be part of a federalist Europe, and this appears the inevitable evolution of the EU, so a change in relationship was equally inevitable.
1	For me the single greatest reason for leaving the EU was to remove ourselves from a system which is undemocratic, inefficient, expensive and above all pointless. Returning sovereignty wholly back to Parliament and no longer being subject to European oversight is worth any cost, economic or political. It is about being our own sovereign nation and being tied as a nation with common purpose rather than a continent of diverse needs.
1	Despite Obama's warnings, many believe that a UK outside the EU would have the ability to forge stronger international alliances with the USA and other countries.
1	Proponents of a Brexit claim that GB should get its sovereignty back since unelected officials in Brussels make rules that elected politicians like the local MP can do nothing about.
0	The EU-28 is treated as its own import/export block on the global stage. Britain sends over 50% of their exports to countries in this bloc. Separating themselves from the European Union gives the country an opportunity to negotiate its own trade partnerships instead of relying on the multinational governing body to do it for them. Although they would no longer benefit from the trades arranged by the EU, they will also have the final say in what happens instead of being a contributing voice to the process.
0	There are estimates that 3 million jobs in Britain are connected to trade policies, procedures, or activities right now. Separating from Europe does create a risk where these employment opportunities could be lost. If trading increases after the separation, then there is a chance that employment growth in this sector could occur. When you factor in the expected drop in immigration rates since the UK no longer follows what the EU mandates, there could be more jobs for people to find in the months and years ahead.
0	How we do that is up to Britain. Whether we do that is up to Britain, in fact. As a free nation we have the choice to, say, follow a Corbynite socialist path, nationalising stuff and strengthening the unions and welfare benefits. Or we can go all Thatcherite (as I suspect Gove and Johnson wish to) and shred workers' rights, the welfare state and shrink taxes and the state. In either case, we can go for more or less free trade, more or less migration, more or less infrastructure investment.
0	As an EU member state the UK makes payments to the bloc's budget and also receives funding, or receipts, from the EU - covering various agricultural, social, economic development and competitiveness programmes.
0	The UK will not be part of the EU Common Fisheries Policy which manages fish stocks across Europe. It outlines quotas for which member states are allowed to catch each type of fish and encouraging the fishing industry by various market interventions.
0	If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would immediately be able to abolish all trading tariffs with the EU. This would automatically then apply to all other trading partners.
0	When the UK leaves the EU it will no longer be signed up to the freedom of movement principle which allows EU citizens to move freely around member states and live and work there as if they are a national of that country.
0	The law-making powers of the MPs in the UK parliament are limited in places by membership of the EU.
0	States always exist in relation to each other, so sovereignty is always relative: we let you do what you want, if you let us do what we want.
0	Dr Usherwood said that this idea of a totally independent state, free to act completely of its own will, is idealistic and does not exist in the modern age due to conventions and agreements the UK is part of all over the world. On a simplistic level, he said, the UK would be able to make its own laws. But that does not mean it is not constrained by organisations and agreements on an international level.
0	If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.
0	For some, the Brexit debate is about wresting back sovereignty over our laws and our borders, regaining some sort of control in a chaotic, globalised world. For others, it’s about the importance of transnational cooperation – on trade, counter-terror and climate change – in that same, chaotic, globalised world. For everyone else it’s an arcane and sometimes tedious debate of interest mainly to political nerds.
0	Many have contended that leaving the EU would be a disaster for British trade. However, research shows that the EU is gradually becoming less of a trade priority for Britain.
0	Approximately 44 percent of British exports in goods and services went to EU member countries in 2017. This is roughly £274 billion out of £616 billion in total exports. Additionally, the EU’s share of the world economy has been shrinking despite growth in its total economic output. In other words, the rest of the world economy is growing faster than the EU’s economy.
0	Indeed, the UK’s exit from the European Union is not a get rich scheme. At the crux of national sovereignty is the right for countries to fail.
0	Trade with the EU countries would continue – it will be in their interests to maintain Britain’s access to the European free market.
0	Britain could negotiate its own trade deals with the likes of China, the United States and Russia on terms tailor-made to suit the national interest.
0	After three years of haggling in the British Parliament, convulsions at the top of the government and pleas for Brussels to delay its exit, Britain closes the book on nearly half a century of close ties with Europe on Jan. 31.
0	Nobody yet knows whether Brexit will be good for the UK or not, and those that claim certain knowledge one way or the other can presumably recite this week’s winning lottery numbers as well. If they cannot then their soothsaying prowess should be viewed with ridicule.
0	What was harder to determine was whether the financial advantages of EU membership, such as free trade and inward investment, outweighed the upfront costs.
0	Britain had a large trade deficit with the EU, they said, and so it would be in Europe’s interest to find a compromise - for goods and financial services.
0	Others suggested that Britain could cut links with Europe and reinvent itself as a Singapore-style economy, free from EU rules and regulations.
0	EU membership involved a worthwhile exchange of sovereignty for influence: in return for agreeing to abide by EU rules, they said, Britain had a seat around the negotiating table and its voice was amplified on the world stage as a result.
0	 Nor, said Remainers, would UK sovereignty be absolute outside the EU: the British government would still be bound by membership of NATO, the UN, the WTO and various treaties and agreements with other nations.
0	Although Brexit would bring some clear-cut advantages, said The Economist, the UK might well find itself “a scratchy outsider with somewhat limited access to the single market, almost no influence and few friends”
0	Under EU law, Britain could not prevent a citizen of another member state from coming to live in the UK.
0	Many Remainers acknowledged that the pace of immigration had led to some difficulties with housing and service provision, but said the net effect had been overwhelmingly positive.
0	It remains unclear how Brexit will affect the jobs market.
0	Since the Brexit vote, the Government has said it will work to maintain security relationships with the EU.
0	Usually Brexit is analysed in economic terms, and I assume this question, too, asks whether Brexit will be economically advantageous for the UK. This will be determined by the coming negotiations.
0	Brexit is good for the UK because we'll be out of the EU. To many this isn't a good thing. But for just as many it is.
0	Brexit can be an opportunity for Africa, but only if the continent's leaders finally move away from corruption.
0	The main reason behind African nations' inability to reap the rewards of international cooperation and investment is corruption. Cooperation with post-Brexit Britain, therefore, can yield significant dividends for Africans only if African countries clean up their acts on the domestic front.
0	If African leaders want to form a genuinely beneficial partnership with post-Brexit Britain, they need to devise a new approach to fighting corruption. Furthermore, they need to start exercising fiscal prudence and entrenching good governance. As long as the upper echelons of African societies remain rotten, a hike in British investments and trade, however significant it may be, will not help the peoples of Africa.
0	The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that will make negotiations more difficult.
0	It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed.
0	Greater control over the border - This can improve security preventing criminals and terrorists from entering the UK. However unwelcoming regime can deter migrants and tourists. Though it is not a given but any raising of borders by the UK would likely be matched by EU member states making it harder for UK citizens to travel in EU.
0	Government finance - The UK is a net contributor to the EU (It gets less out than it puts in, in terms of money) As such once payments to the EU stop the Government can spending this money elsewhere (the NHS is often cited). However some argue that the likely economic contraction caused by leaving the EU will reduce the tax revenue offset any dividend from no longer paying into the EU budget.
0	Setting own policy - The UK will have greater freedom to set its own policies on a range of issues. However in a world with growing corporations it can be argued you need markets and regulators on the scale of the EU to hold them to account. Further regulatory alignment brings down trading barriers for businesses and common regulatory’s provide economy of scale savings for member states.
0	Fishing - The UK has substantial fishing waters, and fishermen have complained for decades about Spanish, Dutch etc fishermen taking large catches from British waters. However it should be noted that a large amount of the UK catch is sold in the EU.
0	Cooperation - The EU facilitates cooperation across a range of fields including ones of high value to the UK such as science, technology and broadcasting. However leaving the EU does mean these sectors will no longer be bound by EU regulation which may enable to them innovate (biotech is often cited as an example were EU fears on GM have inhibited innovation and seen the UK fall behind international competitors like the US)
0	EU oversight - Some feel the EU prevents UK governments implementing policies that they would disapprove of such as lowering workers rights. Others argue that regulation is the enemy of growth and removing it will increase prosperity. There is also no direct reason to believe a UK government would seek to remove rights.
0	Climate change, the UK ambitions on climate change are frequently hamstrung by other EU countries particularly Poland’s lobbying for coal which has generally seen the EU being ineffective at tackling climate change internally and externally. However the global scale of climate change means there is an argument that is better to go slower with a bigger group of nations than faster alone, and that working through the EU gives more weight in international negotiations than the UK lobbying alone.
0	It’s not the UK that needs to leave the EU, but all its members. No, not to destroy the EU, but to reform it and then rejoin again, along with the UK and some new members too. Or perhaps leave it at Schengen’s level only with each country having full control of its defence and immigration.
0	Whatever the outcome of the referendum will be, one thing will never change: British whining. This is a part of their identity.
0	Of course, the question of the EU membership is a matter for the British people to decide. However, we should be more aware of a remarkable moment. The UK votes to leave or remain in the EU on the 23 June will be one of the most important decisions shaping British and European economy in the years to come. The character and importance of the EU may not be the same anymore. The referendum will bring unprecedented consequences for Polish people and Poland too.
0	Britain needs to get maximum access to EU markets while sticking to the government's intention of moving away from EU rules and regulations, allowing more British flexibility to make its own rules or accept different standards - on farming and manufacturing, for instance - in deals it could do with others.
0	The fishing industry is relatively small but politically significant, especially in Scotland. Expectations have been high that it will "take back control" of British waters. But it's politically significant also in other European countries. On the EU side of the table, maintaining access to British waters is a high priority, and if it doesn't get what it wants, then Britain will pay a heavy price. That could mean tariffs on fish being sold into the EU, which is a big British export, or links to other British priorities, such as access to financial service markets in Europe.
0	Even without deals, trade continues. We don't stop exporting and importing. But the point of Brexit was, we were told, to ensure the UK could make its own free trade deals. It was less clear what the advantages of that would be, or which trading relationships were being held back by EU membership.
0	You can assume that others want trade deals. They want good terms for buying from Britain and selling to it. And even without free trade deals, exporting and importing goes on. But other countries also want to defend their interests, both in protecting some industries (in Europe, farming is the most protected sector) and in advancing the interests of exporters.
-1	Britain’s departure from the European Union is so mistaken that it must be reversed, once again with least damage.
-1	Brexit is bad news for the European Union. It is diminishing the EU’s economic, political and strategic weight in the world.
-1	I think that BREXIT is not good for both the Britain and EU.
-1	The final nail in the coffin for a country which once was the “greatest” empire on earth. Those times are clearly over. A country which points a finger at the EU for inefficient behavior, yet not only fails to agree on how Brexit should be delivered since June 2016.
-1	No governing UK politician has the expertise, vision or desire to take the UK out of the EU. I said that in 2012. And I still say that now.
-1	Since Theresa May became the UK prime minister, my opinion of the political consequences of Brexit have worsened. I am now gravely concerned about long term UK political power and process.
-1	I’m old enough to remember the poor, miserable country Britain was before it joined the then EC. There is no way I want to go back to those days.
-1	I voted to remain in the EU. Although the EU is not perfect, I think that overall the EU has been a force for good.
-1	I wanted to stay in the European Union, I wanted stability for my son growing up. I wanted him to be part of something big. Instead he’s going to grow up in uncertainty.
-1	My honest opinion is that Brexit is a catastrophe of the first order, which has been driven by hate, ignorance and lies. Brexit has no worthy objectives and no likely positive outcomes; it is at best pointless and fantastically expensive, and at worst disastrous for Britain politically, economically and socially. Brexit has already made Britain poorer, weaker and meaner, and it will continue to do so no matter what happens next. In the words of Michael Bloomberg, Brexit is the “stupidest thing any country has done besides Trump”.
-1	In my opinion Brexit is a colossal failure and should be used in school how not to conduct a referendum.
-1	Brexit is simply racists saying that Europe is wrong and that USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand should be our new best friends, even though they show no interest in trading with us, and feel even less so now that we are leaving the EU.
-1	Brexit will be incredibly damaging to the economic future of our country and has to be stopped before it goes too far.
-1	A total disaster for Britain brought about solely by David Cameron. Thanks to him, Brexit will ruin things for young people and deprive them of opportunities. It will end freedom of movement, and bring about the break up of the Union.
-1	I’m not a supporter but the people of the UK made their decision so the world is now watching as an spectator waiting until the UK realizes they made a mistake.
-1	I’m British and I am very much Remain. I quite honestly don’t see what we’re getting out of this. Why do people want to get rid of immigrants? My dad is one so I might be a little biased on this particular point, but still - they tend to be an essential part of our work force. Companies are also going to suffer from leaving and that’s not good news for anyone. The whole Irish border thing is a mess and some imbeciles are pushing for a no-deal Brexit, not to mention that from what I’ve read we’re the laughing stock and irritation of Europe. It’s a mess.
-1	There’s no one honest definitive opinion on Brexit. There are as many as there are people interested in the issue.
-1	I think that Brexit is just unnecessary because most people who voted were uneducated older people and the younger people voted to remain. I think that the older generation had lived their lives and they should let the younger generation who are the future of Britain should get to do what they want with their country. I certainly think that Brexit is just a referendum that is a burden of Britain.
-1	I voted against Brexit. It's an act of self harm. I can't envision any positives from it.
-1	In principle, I am a remainer, and do not support the UK leaving the European Union. If it were up to me, the UK would remain in a reformed EU.
-1	In short, no I do not support Brexit, it sounded like a terrible idea to me in 2016 and I haven’t seen anything since to dissuade me of that, but I suppose that I have to put up with it now.
-1	In my opinion it is one of the single most stupid decisions taken by a democratic process.
-1	It is a catastrophe: economically, politically, socially. It is the worst thing to happen to UK since WW2, and the worst decision made by UK in a long, long time. It makes Britain poorer, weaker, less influential, less respected, bitterly divided.
-1	I don’t believe that Brexit will resolve any of those key issues, and I don’t see why those issues should have to wait while the politicians are overwhelmed with trying to satisfy unachievable demands related to leaving the EU regardless of the damage that will be done to the nation.
-1	It’s wasteful, expensive, divisive and pointless. It’ll not fix any of the issues people think it would, however it’ll create many new ones.
-1	After Brexit was first voted for in 2016, there were fears a house price crisis could be just around the corner. In November 2018, the Bank of England made headlines with a report warning that a 'no-deal Brexit' could lead to the economy shrinking and house prices falling by close to 30%.
-1	Both U.K. voters and lawmakers expressed frustration with the situation, and many looked to former Prime Minister David Cameron to negotiate a new agreement with the 28-nation consortium. However, given that he failed to do so, sentiment became worse and gave voters the clout they need so that Britain can exit, or "Brexit," the EU.
-1	The failure of the UK to achieve an open trading and investment with the EU post-Brexit would have negative implications for the UK and EU, and provide little, if any, gain for the US.
-1	Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warned credit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer.
-1	Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.
-1	If any prime minister in the past had shown such a determined ignorance of the dynamics of global capitalism, the massed ranks of British capital would have stepped in to force a change of direction. Yet today, while the CBI and the Financial Times call for the softest possible Brexit, the Tory party is no longer listening.
-1	The fact is that the capitalists who do support Brexit tend to be very loosely tied to the British economy. This is true of hedge funds, of course – but also true for manufacturers such as Sir James Dyson, who no longer produces in the UK. The owners of several Brexiter newspapers are foreign, or tax resident abroad – as is the pro-Brexit billionaire Sir James Ratcliffe of Ineos.
-1	Brexit also speaks to the weakness of the state, which was itself once tied to the governing party – and particularly the Conservatives. The British state once had the capacity to change the United Kingdom and its relations to the rest of the world radically and quickly, as happened in the second world war, and indeed on accession to the common market.
-1	Brexit is a necessary crisis, and has provided a long overdue audit of British realities. It exposes the nature of the economy, the new relations of capitalism to politics and the weakness of the state. It brings to light, in stunning clarity, Brexiters’ deluded political understanding of the UK’s place in the world. From a new understanding, a new politics of national improvement might come; without it we will remain stuck in the delusional, revivalist politics of a banana monarchy.
-1	Brexit harms the UK’s neighbours; potentially creates a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland; ignores devolved governments and is against the wishes of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
-1	Staying in the single market would make trading easier. Many commentators have stated that it is within the interests of the City and the UK as a whole to maintain free trade with the EU. Leaving with a deal in place would also prevent the uncertainty that surrounds a no-deal Brexit.
-1	The major issue is that it will become a lot more expensive for Britain to ship out or bring in goods. This is because we will not have tariff-free access to EU markets under EU rules. That is just how it goes. If it does become more expensive for either party, this will hit sales and competition.
-1	The EU is far from perfect and there is a case for leaving it. I’m happy to acknowledge that. So far however, no one has offered me a persuasive case that the positives of doing so outweigh the negatives.
-1	Nothing the EU has ever done validates this high handed, dictatorial approach.
-1	It is somewhere between bad & catastrophic. (*) Poorer, more divided, more mean-spirited. A lot of industries will be crippled or close. The economy as a whole will be badly hurt.
-1	Putin wanted a weaker, more divided Europe. So he benefits.
-1	We don’t gain anything economically from leaving. It’s that simple. There are no economic or trade benefits that we can avail ourselves of which offset the negative impact of leaving. We were the 5th largest economy in the world, due to Brexit we are now 7th with Italy in 8th breathing down our necks. As an economy globally we depend more than any other on Services, but Services particularly high value regulated licensed services such as Banking, Insurance, Media, Airlines etc which cannot be easily traded internationally outside the benign EU markets.
-1	Brexit is not good for the UK. It is a desperately regressive and misguided step in the wrong direction. It represents a return to the worst form of nationalistic jingoism of the imperialist era.
-1	Another unquestionable reality is that Brexit has made the United Kingdom a more divided society. It is a division rooted not just in politics, but fundamental values. The principles that define our personalities and decisions as people have grown apart.
-1	Brexit will be bad for the EU. The EU will loose one a member of the UN permanent security council and one of Europe’s only two military powers.
-1	More UK trade is exposed to any new Brexit deal, than the EU. And Brexit is causing an ongoing domestic political crisis and deepening social divisions.
-1	In my opinion, NONE of the people leading the Brexit side actually wanted to leave, I think it was a stunt to try and get reform, and/or a better deal for the UK. This was, imo, a fair thing to ask for, as there are many negative things about the EU. There have been people all over the EU asking for reform for years now, and they have made many valid points, backed with evidence to prove that the EU has been damaging to certain nations, industries, and economies. The EU answer to these problems is to simply throw money at them to make them go away, and make the richer nations pay for it, rather than repealing legislation, or writing new legislation.
-1	Brexit isn't good for any of the sides involved. Both lose something. The only difference is that one side will be far worse affected by it. I'm glad to be living in the side that loses the least. I'm sad for the pain it will provoke on the other side of the channel. But i can do nothing to change it. Even if I was in a position to do so, I'm not sure I would do it. It wasn't my choice to leave, after all. My choice was for making this better, together for all of us.
-1	Disaster. Britain was one of the most respected countries in the world, famous for being calm, sensible, kind and doing the right thing. That benefited our industries and made the U.K. a nice place for skilled people to come and settle. That enhanced our culture and made us richer. That's changed. We aren't hospitable or tolerant any more. Desperately needed NHS workers are leaving to go back to their home countries because they don't feel welcomed. Lucrative businesses that were once pretty committed to the UK are now opening offices in Dublin or Frankfurt because they fear the Brexit future. Brexit is turning into an act of unnecessary self-harm.
-1	In truth, the EU has preserved peace in Europe since 1945. This most war-like of continents enjoys peace now, after centuries of blood-letting. UKIP predicted the collapse of the EU when we leave. The right wing is infatuated with British importance, and likes to imagine it as a vital global force. It isn't even a vital European force, it turns out. Apparently the continental countries understand the EU project and why it's vital. The Brits en masse have never understood and probably never will. Most Brits can't even learn a foreign language.
0	Almost no one in 2016, certainly not Johnson, imagined the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all. Today, despite the ongoing talks, no deal is a Johnson government policy option.
0	There is no perfect choice to be made on Brexit.
0	For a long time, it seemed like Brexit might not actually happen. In fact, it was only a few months ago that a so-called 'People's Vote', a second EU referendum, seemed a distinct possibility.
0	Brexit would have continued to dominate British and European politics for the foreseeable future.
0	Another unquestionable reality is that Brexit has made the United Kingdom a more divided society.
0	Now they discuss the future relationship between the UK and the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit was leaving the EU.  And the EU just like the UK does and has the right to say how they want the future relationship to be. And if they don’t find common ground it is the no deal relationship.
0	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU.
0	It is not the EU that is destined to collapse, but the UK, as Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland secede from the UK to apply independently to the EU.
0	The Governments approach to Brexit has been appalling - they have rushed in with no plan whatsoever and have simply ignored a substantial portion of the populace (we won, you lost, now shut up).
0	I think that there will be surprisingly little difference between staying in and leaving the EU.
0	Disentangling the United Kingdom from the European Union has suffered a tremendous backlash from UK citizens, mainly because Brexit narrowly passed by a mere 1% of voters. Therefore, Brexit remains deeply divided.
0	Brexit is simple, the EU will still exist, the UK will still have to obey certain rules if we want to trade easily with the EU, the UK isn't going to find a new path, the UK isn't going to trade with the rest of the world better or more easily than the EU.
0	It’s mistake of UK and partly EU because EU is the greatest international project in the human history.
0	There is a serious issue with any kind of exit from the EU even no deal. We have government with no majority and very little parliamentary time left and an exit requires legislation to be passed by Parliament before October 31st.
0	I think that only after several years have past, we will be able to objectively see what are the consequences of Brexit. UK leaving EU will definitely have an impact on both sides.
0	There may well be pros and cons of leaving the EU, though the very act of leaving might be considered a sign of English xenophobia and arrogance towards a group of good partners in the past.
0	Brexit is undoubtedly the most complex event in our lifetime.
0	The UK is breaking up because of Brexit. Only England voted for the Brexit deal. Scotland, Wales, N.I. voted against.
0	My honest opinion is that some British people will benefit from Brexit, others won’t.
0	Even if I have misgivings about Brexit, just over half the country who turned out to vote on that fateful day voted for Brexit, and since we are a democracy it looks like we are, indeed, leaving. I cannot argue too much with that.
0	I believe it was inevitable. Although Britain entered the EU to catch up with the modern world, British leaders soon discovered the EU needed to be remade for the twenty-first century. Whether or a not a referendum were held, the idea that “Europe is necessary” and “Europe can be reformed” was likely to be tested over and over in British politics.
0	I believe many Euro politicians and officials certainly didn't want and never wanted Britain in the EU to begin with and I believe that is still true today.
0	I just hope those promoting Brexit do not harbour unrealistic expectations of how wonderful things will be after they leave the EU.
0	Even in the year before the referendum, opinion polls fluctuated between the two options. However, once the results of the 2015 election were out, Brexit became increasingly likely.
0	Brexit is supported by a large number of factions that each seem to have a different idea of what Brexit means, and what it is intended to achieve.
0	After three years of haggling in the British Parliament, convulsions at the top of the government and pleas for Brussels to delay its exit, Britain closes the book on nearly half a century of close ties with Europe on Jan. 31.
0	A public vote - called a referendum - was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. The Leave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m - but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below).
0	The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries.The discussions have been mainly over the "divorce" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as the Withdrawal Agreement.
0	"Article 50 is part of an EU treaty (an agreement kind of like a contract) that sets out how EU member countries can leave.Article 50 was triggered by Theresa May while she was the UK Prime Minister in March 2017. Since then the deadline has been extended a number of times. This was because in order to agree a deal with the EU, Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons had to vote to approve the PM’s deal first. The current PM, Boris Johnson, put a deal forward that was passed by.
0	MPs in December 2019. This meant the deadline was extended to January 31st 2020 and formalised as the date that the UK would legally leave the EU."
0	The negotiating period has also seen Britain's political parties face their own crises. Lawmakers have left both the Conservative and Labour parties in protest. There have been allegations of anti-semitism in the Labour party, and Corbyn has been criticized for his handling of the issue. In September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson expelled 21 MPs for voting to delay Brexit.
0	One of the most politically thorny issues facing Brexit negotiators has been the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. and U.K. citizens living in the EU.
0	The UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in June 2016. It followed decades of increasing hostility to the European project in the United Kingdom, reinforced in recent years by a rise in nationalist sentiment, particularly in England. Other factors such as austerity and frustration with traditional politics have also been cited as reasons — amid a wider debate over the role of the nation state and the rise of populism in an age of globalisation.
0	Britain is seeking a narrower free trade deal similar to those the EU has done with countries such as Canada. Brussels stresses it has always been clear that the UK’s geographical proximity to the EU, and degree of economic integration with Europe, mean the same rules cannot apply.
0	Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the transition period will not be extended, but the European Commission has warned that the timetable will be extremely challenging.
0	If we’re all totally honest, none of us have a crystal ball and I don’t think we can really say whether it will be good for the UK or not. Many of us feel it quite unlikely that it will prove good for the UK, but there are perfectly valid arguments to the contrary.
0	Immigration and the economy will also be important in forthcoming talks about the UK's future relationship with the EU. The UK will have to decide what rules on immigration it wants and how much it wishes to depart from rules governing what can be bought and sold in the EU.
0	There have been many rounds of talks since then, and from the start, the EU was ready to negotiate as soon as the UK had notified its intention to withdraw. As the EU treaties foresee the possibility of a withdrawal in the now well-known Article 50, the process was well defined.
0	There have been complex matters to resolve, but the priority has been to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK in order to reduce uncertainty and disruption for citizens, businesses and member states alike.
0	It is important to note that the British never had the opportunity to have a second Brexit referendum. General elections served as measurement tools as political parties became representatives of different stances about Brexit.
0	The balance of influence in Europe would shift from the liberalising north to the interventionist south, with Berlin more exposed in policy debates and finding it harder to block initiatives.
0	All member states will feel the impact of Brexit as Europe will lose international esteem and foreign policy influence and have less leverage in trade negotiations.
0	Leaving the EU will introduce new costs of trade between the UK and the EU that make it harder for UK firms to do business with the rest of Europe. However, the extent to which trade barriers increase will depend upon the nature of the post-Brexit relationship the UK agrees with the EU.
0	For each case we estimate the predicted effect of Brexit on UK income per capita ten years after the deal is implemented relative to an alternative scenario where the UK remains in the EU. We report both estimates from our static trade model and estimates that adjust for the effect of trade integration on productivity. Trade integration can raise productivity through increased competition, or stimulating innovation, but these effects are not included in the static model. The estimates that adjust for productivity changes are around two and a half times as large as the static estimates.
1	Boris (Johnson) needs to deliver Brexit by any means, including suspending parliament if necessary, in order to prevent MPs (Members of Parliament) from stopping it.
1	What they don't want is a very successful UK as soon as we leave the EU as they would see that as a commentary on the European Union.
1	Ian Lees tweeted: "Absolutely and totally agree. No more extensions, no more payments, and sever completely all umbilical cords to the EU."
1	So, to some extent, the Brexit negotiations have helped to reconfigure European public opinion in favour of integration.
1	The UK was never really the same as other European countries. You still needed a passport and go through customs. To me I am happy they are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
1	I think the sooner we are out of the EU the better.
1	I was in favour of EU reform, but it became clear with Cameron’s failed attempts that the EU would never reform. It is a fanatical, extremist project that is in total denial that it is failing. I therefore voted leave.
1	I personally am very happy that we voted to leave the EU and am glad that we may now be able regain control over our future.
1	I wanted the UK to leave the EU so that hopefully a fairer approach towards foreigners working, living and especially studying in the UK can be adopted by the Government without the prerequisite built-in bias towards EU citizens as required by the EU Commission.
1	I am having optimistic beliefs that we will leave on the 31st. If we don’t leave on the 31st then the UK would have signed away its Democracy, Sovereignty and Beliefs.
1	If we stay in the EU and give more and more power to the EU over the UK then what? We would have the Germans, French and Dutch making decisions for us with their populations which together far outnumber the British.
1	Staying in the EU is not in the interest of any nation of Europe but Britain seems to be the only one strong enough to decide it’s time to leave before we go crashing down with the rest of the member states and their vulnerable, weak Euro.
1	Brexit will be the best thing that happened to the UK for decades, in fact since we joined the club. The EU is scared, there are other members who could leave, so they want to make it as difficult as possible for the UK, as a deterrent. After we leave we will be free to agree trade deals with our old partners, as well as new ones, like the more open China.
1	I want Britons to vote leave because I see absolutely no hope in the future of EU. It is not because I think Europe is a bloodthirsty continent bent on perpetual war, but simply that the present structure is just unsustainable.
1	I do not support Brexit, but I support the EU even less. For me it is not about the interaction between the UK and the EU that is the problem, but about the UK being a supporter of the EU and it’s business regarding the smaller and less developed countries it has absorbed.
1	I'm generally pro-EU but at this point I would just want both sides to finish this mess and Britain to leave.
1	I think that exiting the EU is a great decision and I am proud to have been one of those who made it.
1	Now we can start getting to work on undoing the damage that the EU has been doing to us for so long, and prove to the world that Brexit was a good idea, for us at least.
1	I think it’s a great decision. True, there will be some negatives from leaving, both what we would loose, and what will happen. But I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives.
1	Thanks god the UK has left the EU before it is too late. Just wait when the time has come the UK triumph outside the EU. That will be the end of the EU.
1	In my opinion, Brexit is a good decision on behalf of the UK. It’ll have the opportunity to grow without any dictation from the EU. It is considered one of the major benefits that the UK will have - the liberty in its affairs.
1	Brexit is the greatest opportunity this country will ever have! If handled right by our politicians (which is a totally different question), the UK will once more join the ranks of the other democratic nations of the world, able to make its own rules and laws without interference from an unelected and unaccountable organisation, enter trade deals on its own behalf, and once more be able to control its borders.
1	I am a supporter of democracy so would be hypocritical if I didn't support Brexit. Parliament voted overwhelmingly to give the referendum in the first place so it would be complete madness if it didn't vote in favour of the outcome.
1	I voted for it on the basis of protecting the UK's control over it's decisions and also because I felt net migration to the UK and England in particular was too great for a country of this size to manage without it adding to the population enough to adversely affect the Countryside.
1	Watching the ongoing process of Brexit handling in Britain, I now finally understand why that very Brexit is simply a consequential decision and a must. If a people and their democratically elected government can't agree on facts, expert's counsel, common sense, and what they actually want, even just within their own confined country, producing a full blown mess like it's rarely seen, how can they be expected to closely deal with (or even transfer that to) the rest of Europe, let alone the world. Let them 'take back control' - of their own bloody mess, that is.
1	Speaking to CNBC’s Hadley Gamble at the Doha Forum, Mnuchin said he expects Johnson will now get his deal on Brexit done with his commanding majority in the House of Commons and said the two sides were “absolutely” moving toward trade discussions.
1	Congratulations to Boris Johnson on his great WIN! Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U. Celebrate Boris!
1	Next, at the margin, our looming departure is a slight improvement. You can see that most clearly in the employment and wage data. As the amount of cheap eastern and central European labour has started to fall, employers have had to pay their people a bit more. As the research consultancy High Frequency Economics noted in an analysis of the figures: 'We believe we are seeing a change in the composition of the workforce as the economy loses foreign workers, largely in low wage jobs'. Much as the textbooks would suggest, with a lower supply of cheap labour companies are starting to restructure so that they use fewer people and pay the ones they have a little more. Sure, some companies that are completely dependent on low paid labour will suffer. But on balance that will be an improvement, especially as those higher wages will soon translate into higher spending, creating more growth.
1	In truth, the drama around Brexit may be a political earthquake. But to the economy, it is already largely an irrelevance. And on balance, it is turning into a positive.
1	Except that is not quite what happened. First, we learnt that the economy overall expanded by 0.3 per cent in July, significantly faster than the 0.1 per cent expected, and better than most of our main rivals. Next, we found out that the trade deficit narrowed slightly as imports fell. Finally, we learned that employment was at record highs and that wages were still growing at record rates. Add in a Chancellor who is about to start spending money with carefree abandon and there is no reason why it shouldn't improve from here. It isn't fantastic. But it is a decent performance from a mature economy facing what is meant to be its biggest economic challenge in a generation.
1	Why did the UK vote for Brexit? My guess is that emotions -- British anger and frustration over giving up perceived sovereignty to the EU over immigration and other issues -- overpowered rationality -- the desire to preserve the strength of the UK economy.
1	In theory, there’s no reason why UK retailers can’t benefit by servicing this pent-up demand. Successfully doing so — particularly in the face of, for instance, uncertainty over customs arrangements after Brexit — is going to take nerve, commitment, and impeccable customer focus. But it is possible.
1	But neither Brexit nor the EU are everything. To take a couple of examples, London trades nearly twice as much foreign currency as New York, its nearest rival.
1	Of course the alarmism was all nonsense. The Royal Academy, whose Picasso exhibition I was lucky enough to view, is a world-class institution. Why would the Prado in Madrid or the Louvre in Paris refuse to lend to it and receive works on loan from it because Britain had left the European Union? Did the propagandists honestly believe that without its EU membership, Britain would return to some pre-Picasso world? Some echt period of British art in which we strove to eradicate all Continental influence from our pure British culture? The idea is laughable, and yet in young people in particular it caused fear where it should have caused giggles.
1	Ever since Boris Johnson won his 80-seat-majority Conservative mandate in December, and even more since Brexit became not a threat or a sentence but a simple transition and reality, the vitriol has abated. The Cassandras have dried up, perhaps finally hoarse as well as provably wrong.
1	It was in nobody’s interest to make Brexit harder than it needed to be. There was no interest in making British and EU citizens unable to enter each other’s countries, or in creating some kind of cultural or artistic boycott among the most artistically fruitful cultures in history. Brexit has happened. And for now the most striking feature is the beautiful, too often overlooked marvel of nothing happening.
1	A no-deal Brexit would see the UK leave the free trade zone, do away with EU regulations, and eradicate the need to accept the free movement of people. This would provide the opportunity to negotiate new trade deals with other countries.
1	The EU is Britain’s biggest trading partner, and there’s no guarantee the UK will get better trade deals once it leaves. Adding to this, the UK could still end up being forced to comply with EU laws and regulations, as is the case with Norway and Iceland.
1	But arguably, the biggest issue for why a Brexit would be a terrible idea for our economy is how it will impact the lifeblood of Britain — the service industry.
1	Most viruses die down or disappear over time. The British anti-EU virus is a particularly virulent strain and there were fears that it might take root elsewhere in the EU. But the shambles over Brexit has been a powerful antidote. At some point the virus will have run its course in the UK as well.
1	Deal will be a disaster. It is not Project Fear. Project Fear is a tactic used by the Brexiteers to shut down debate. Just look at the impact of the drones on Gatwick yesterday or the problems with Calais (Project Stack) a few years back. Think of those and multiply by a very large number and that is the impact of a no deal. Plenty to be fearful about. Dismissing it out of hand is not a solution, particularly if you are not directly responsible for the chaos, i.e. not in a position of authority. Most Brexit ultras have either abrogated their responsibility by either refusing to serve or have resigned from a position of authority. They continue to lob political hand grenades from the sidelines in order to achieve their “political wet dream” of a no deal Brexit.
1	The UK could then assume her rightful place in the world once again, as an outward-looking and self-confident nation. She can start harnessing her soft power and diplomatic prestige in service of the regained or newly found role in the world without the constraints and liabilities of EU membership.
1	The decision to leave the EU was the right one, which doesn’t necessarily mean everyone’s reasons for voting that way, were right. Some voted through fear of foreigners, some voted through nostalgia, some voted to give the establishment a kick in the teeth. All bad reasons.
1	Brexit is the start of Britain remaking itself as a nation, finding its niche in the world as a medium sized economic and military power. The process is risky, will be hard, but it is necessary, and will be well worth the effort.
1	There's the £350,000,000 a week that we won't be paying to Brussels but will be paying to the NHS. We will gain that.
1	There’s complete control of our borders, even that between Ireland and Northern Ireland, so we can keep all the foreign scroungers out.
1	The benefits are we will be free to negotiate trading arrangements with the rest of the world as we see fit whereas at the moment we are effectively in a straightjacket because this is something which is currently carried out by the EU on behalf of the member states. Amazingly a lot of people in the UK are not aware that we do not have the ability to negotiate a free trade deal on our own because we gave up that right in 1973 when we joined the EEC which has now evolved into the EU. As the world’s fifth largest economy we should have little difficulty negotiating these ourselves when you consider Switzerland which is only the 19th largest economy in the world with a GDP of $677 has little problem gaining access to world markets.
1	The real "benefit" of a Brexit is that UK may be able to close its borders and prevent or limit further immigration.
1	One of the arguments for Brexit, one of the few good arguments, was that there is a lack of clarity on what the EU is and what it is for. Brexit is forcing the EU to define itself properly and sort out what its core values are.
1	Seeing how the markets and politicians have dealt with the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, the worst refugee problem since World War II and constant squabbles over EU lawmaking that wrecks national sovereignty, I've become fully unstuck from the mud of the pro-EU camp and will sit on the fence until we vote.
1	There are a few things that Britons are getting really tired of, and a growing mountain of examples to show how the UK doesn't really have much of a say in what happens within the bloc.
1	It is a terrible idea, and you can watch the disaster slowly unfold before you. Our fellow Europeans will be as sad to see the self inflicted harm we are doing to ourselves as the unfortunate British citizens who will suffer as a result.
1	My support of Brexit comes from the political effects of the EU. I regard it as severely compromised in its basic structure. It’s an institution that will always tend towards graft, bureaucracy, idealism, and top-down decision making. It is inherently not pragmatic or democratic. More importantly, in my lifetime I’ve seen no real will to change it from within. Not only is it poorly constructed, it doesn’t recognise the fact.
1	So no, leaving isn’t something that will make Britain better than it is now. I believe that it may however prevent Britain from becoming much worse in 60 years.
1	The EU is supposed to have experts’ approval, but the EU wrecked the economies of Spain, Greece and Italy; the EU has no brains, or heart, when it comes to international trade.
1	It was a very good decision in my opinion. A very simple argument lies at the heart of the reason most Brexit voters chose to take back control, as I see it the outcome is the best we could have expected, although 65% for Brexit would have been an even better outcome. The reality is that the referendum secured a majority in favour of leaving the EU, hence the outcome is historic and a turning point for the U.K. because it enables us to shape our own future, in a way that suits us, without having to be beholden to a faceless bureaucracy based in Brussels, which is effectively controlled from Berlin.
1	For the EU in the short term it will be better. It will allow the EU to focus more on integration at all levels. The UK position of half in half out was detrimental to this evolution, which in my opinion will force the much needed democratization and transparency of EU institutions.
1	Brexiteers argued that leaving the EU would result in an immediate cost saving, as the country would no longer contribute to the EU budget. In 2016, Britain paid in ?13.1bn, but it also received ?4.5bn worth of spending, said Full Fact, “so the UK’s net contribution was ?8.5bn”. What was harder to determine was whether the financial advantages of EU membership, such as free trade and inward investment, outweighed the upfront costs.
1	Pro-European petitioners argued that while there is no legal doubt that Britain could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 member states.
1	For Brexiteers, sovereignty was seen as a simple win: even the most ardent Remainers had to admit that EU membership involved giving up some control over domestic affairs.
1	Brexit supporters were adamant that a deal to allow continued tariff-free trading would be secured even if the UK left the single market. Britain had a large trade deficit with the EU, they said, and so it would be in Europe’s interest to find a compromise - for goods and financial services.
1	Agreeing a Norway-style deal with the EU that would see the UK remain in the single market and customs union remains the public’s most palatable option. A quarter of Britons (26%) see this as a good outcome, while a further 23% see it as an acceptable compromise.
1	Brexiteers said Britain should “regain control” of its borders. Most wanted a substantial cut in immigration, although some said it was less about numbers than the principle of national sovereignty.
1	The British political system is littered with the bones of new parties. Britain’s first-past-the-post system has severely hampered the electoral performance of many otherwise popular parties, most notably the SDP in the 1980s but also more recently the Greens and UKIP. Not that it stops parties from trying of course. And on the face of it, things look good for the latest challengers. The Brexit Party and Lib Dems are currently polling as highly as the Tories and Labour, and both performed well at the European Parliament elections. But the danger is that many people used the EU elections as a protest vote, and may come to reconsider their voting intention once the prospect of a general election becomes a reality.
1	Johnson and Hunt have vowed to tear up the backstop, the fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, which both men have voted for at least once. Recent reports have suggested the EU is ready to offer a five-year transition to break the deadlock over the backstop.
1	Former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who was in favour of Brexit, said Britain was leaving the “door open” to terrorist attacks by remaining in the EU. “This open border does not allow us to check and control people,” he argued.
1	In the five years since the European refugee crisis began, controversies related to migration have deeply affected political landscapes across the EU, yet no “European solutions” have so far been found. A new study by the European Journalism Observatory (EJO) now shines a light on the media’s role in the migration debate.
1	EJO’s comparative analysis reveals that in each country, the media tell different stories about migrants and refugees. Clear differences in the quantity and quality of coverage can be discerned not only between Western and Central Eastern Europe, but even within Western Europe. The study also reveals a number of blind spots in the coverage of migration.
1	A UK outside the EU would have the capacity to better control its immigration and prioritize British citizens over the citizens of other European states. With the increased sovereignty the British government could also apply enhanced counter-terrorist measures, which currently may be challenged by European legislation.
1	Will the Euro collapse? What is the future of the EU? Many are pessimistic about Europe. The UK could become an attractive investment center outside the EU if the European project collapses. London could be a safe haven for investors trying to escape from the uncertainties surrounding the EU.
1	Pro-Brexit leaders claimed that Britain could fare as well as Norway outise the EU. Norway, has access to the single market but can opt out to some of the policies enacted by the European commission. However, it seems that now the most likely Brexit scenario entails leaving the Single Market too.
1	Currently the capacity of the UK to shape decisions in the EU is limited because Germany has become the top dog in the European Union. If the UK leaves the EU, British people will regain the capacity to decide their own futures.
1	Brexit may help the country experience immediate cost savings. One of the reasons that Brexit passed during its referendum involved the cost of membership to the European Union. Britain paid ?13.1 billion in membership dues to the multinational structure in 2016, while receiving just ?4.5 billion in return through spending. That means the nation experienced a loss of ?8.6 billion in just the one year. If you were to multiply that figure over a decade, then the savings would create a sufficient cash reserve that could be useful in a variety of ways.
1	Brexit would shift the emphasis of trade for Britain. The EU-28 is treated as its own import/export block on the global stage. Britain sends over 50% of their exports to countries in this bloc. Separating themselves from the European Union gives the country an opportunity to negotiate its own trade partnerships instead of relying on the multinational governing body to do it for them. Although they would no longer benefit from the trades arranged by the EU, they will also have the final say in what happens instead of being a contributing voice to the process.
1	Brexit establishes the sovereignty of Britain. Being part of the European Union requires Britain to give up some of its unique identity. They were forced to give up some control over their domestic affairs to maintain its positive membership status. The goal with this process is to give the Parliament more of its traditional power instead of ceding to the mandates that come from the EU governing body. Instead of wondering about how the membership bloc works on any given day, or who is in charge, Brexit makes it possible for the country to grab the steering wheel once again as they steer toward their fate.
1	Brexit would reduce the issues with forced immigration associated with the EU. Under the laws of the European Union, member nations cannot prevent anyone from another state that is also a member from moving to live there. Britons had the right to move elsewhere to live and work, but so did everyone else. This structure created a pattern of immigration where roughly 800,000 people moved into the country to take advantage of the opportunities in the UK. Although China and India are the most significant sources of foreign workers in the country, separating from Europe allows Britain to maintain the pace of immigration that works best for their nation.
1	Brexit offers the possibility of new jobs. There are estimates that 3 million jobs in Britain are connected to trade policies, procedures, or activities right now. Separating from Europe does create a risk where these employment opportunities could be lost. If trading increases after the separation, then there is a chance that employment growth in this sector could occur. When you factor in the expected drop in immigration rates since the UK no longer follows what the EU mandates, there could be more jobs for people to find in the months and years ahead.
1	Brexit could improve border security. Iain Duncan Smith, who is the former Work and Pensions Secretary, suggests that the recent spike in terrorism experienced in Europe would continue to be a risk for Britain domestically because of the free movements that the EU allows. By taking advantage of Brexit’s structure, Smith suggests that the country could close their open borders to begin checking visitors and controlling the flow of people movement.
1	Brexit could help to stop issues with bureaucracy. There are regulatory frameworks that the European Union implemented that do not always work well for Britain’s needs. That led most of the people who were for the referendum to feel like the membership block is a bureaucratic burden with far too many regulations to follow. By creating a separation between the two governing structures, it becomes possible for the local government to create a framework that is much more specific to the needs of everyone while still benefiting from the relationships formed during their time in the EU-28.
1	Brexit would create additional savings opportunities worth considering. Consumers in Britain would no longer be asked to follow EU policies like the Common Agricultural Policy when Brexit occurs. More than ?1 billion each year in subsidies goes to foreign farmers that help to make them competitive, so removal of this could lower prices at the supermarkets. There is also the Common Fisheries Policy that places regulations on the local industry that are believed to be keeping it from reaching its full potential.
1	Sterling has been depreciated and devalued beyond recognition, but the UK has never properly defaulted on its debt. The UK was outside the eurozone but, with our financial, political and economic structures so closely integrated, we were more exposed to its inherent flaws. Eventually, the diplomatic pressure to join the euro would intensify again – we would be told we could not be in the single market without being in the single currency. The euro's problems will not dissipate until Europe has a fiscal union; in other words, a European Treasury and a proper European government. No sign of that.
1	Once again, we can return to world markets to buy cheap food in particular, outside the Common Agricultural Policy. We can take advantage of more efficient producers of cereals, butter, meat and all the rest, and take advantage of surpluses from across the planet. Much the same goes for everything else we import. That would mean our wages buy more and inflation would be lower, and, with the cheaper grocery bills, would help poorer people. More expensive food was one of worst consequences of joining the EEC in 1973.
1	Eastern European immigration raised British economic growth and made us all richer. The problem was political acceptability and the uncertainty about how large it might become – maybe to the point where the economic costs exceeded the benefits. It also meant there might be less non-EU migration, given the Government's "aspiration" on numbers. Now we can have migration with a policy the public actually support – a valuable thing, and the only way it can be secure and sustainable. Nurses from Zimbabwe, refugees from Syria, builders from Albania, students from China – we can have them all in a rational, planned way.
1	Trade deals with other countries may be easier to win Simply because we can just negotiate and agree, we do not need a consensus among 28 quarrelling, disparate countries. We traded with the rest of the world, and the EU, before the EU was invented and can do so again.
1	Obviously, there's more to an economy than fish, but it is the case that for some of the most deprived, and once prosperous, parts of the country there is the hope of returning the fishing grounds, the fleets and the jobs that went with them. Grimsby, Fleetwood, Cornwall: these are the places that may well be much better off in a few years. It was always morally wrong to sacrifice coastal communities for the sake of the EU. Without EU interference we could, if we wanted, nationalise or otherwise support key industries such as steel. Again, such policies and priorities will be democratically set through parliament.
1	am I enlightening my audience or obfuscating the truth, allowing them to make a free choice or pumping propaganda down their throats, and working in the interests of the readers and viewers who ultimately pay my wages or for owners whose primary loyalty is to shareholders?
1	THE Queen has been hailed as a backer of Brexit tonight after details emerged of an extraordinary alleged bust-up between her and Nick Clegg over Europe.
1	ON June 23, 2016, the people of Britain went to the polls and voted in favour of leaving the European Union. It was a clear, decisive mandate. But it was not respected. We did not leave the EU on March 29 this year. There are many reasons why the people were let down, which I detail in my book. Like the huge majority for Remain in Parliament — and, indeed, the civil service.
1	The sheer staggering uselessness of the Prime Minister in negotiations. Theresa May’s daft decision to call an election in 2017, which lost her a parliamentary majority. And more, much more besides.  But crucial in stopping Brexit was an organisation that is supposed to be impartial.
1	A vast, top-heavy, bureaucratic institution that trousers ?154.50 of your money every year, like it or not. Yes, of course, it’s the BBC. The BBC behaved itself in the run-up to the referendum. It represented the two sides of the debate quite properly. It had to. It’s the law. The Representation of the People Act. But since then, the gloves have come off.  For the past three years, we have been subjected to a deluge of unashamed anti-Brexit propaganda, every day, without fail. And not just on news and current affairs programmes, either.
1	Brexit, she says, will mean the UK can “start making our own laws, look after our own nation, get trade back and our industry back.”
1	Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual. When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only.
1	Driving licences and pet passports. As long as they are valid, these will continue to be accepted.
1	These are the cards that provide UK nationals with state-provided medical treatment in case of illness or accident. They can be used in any EU country (as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and will continue to be valid during the transition period.
1	Freedom of movement will continue to apply during the transition, so UK nationals will still be able to live and work in the EU as they currently do. The same applies for EU nationals wanting to live and work in the UK.
1	UK nationals living in the EU will continue to receive their state pension and will also receive the annual increase.
1	The UK will continue to pay into the EU budget during the transition. This means existing schemes, paid for by EU grants, will continue to be funded.
1	The Brexit Party leader said: "Let us celebrate tonight as we have never done before. "This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation."
1	As politicians squabble over border controls, yet another lorry load of migrants arrives in the UK from mainland Europe. Opposition to the arrival of immigrants in the UK is not new. Rising concern about ‘New Commonwealth’ immigration prompted the British Election Study (BES) to begin asking the public about immigration as far back as 1964, although in those early years it did not ask the question to ‘coloured’ respondents. Throughout this period, the majority of people in Britain agreed that there were too many immigrants in the UK.
1	Children are to be banned from taking part in traditional Christmas games, from blowing up balloons to blowing on party whistles, because of new EU safety rules that have just entered into force.
1	As home secretary campaigning to stay in the European Union, she described it as "inconceivable" that Brexit would not lead to changes to the border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
1	"There is such a rich thesaurus now of things that I have said that have been, one way or another, through what alchemy I do not know, somehow misconstrued, that it would really take me too long to engage in a full global itinerary of apology to all concerned," he said. "I think most people who read these things in their proper context can see exactly what was intended."
1	Seeing how the markets and politicians have dealt with the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, the worst refugee problem since World War II and constant squabbles over EU lawmaking that wrecks national sovereignty, I've become fully unstuck from the mud of the pro-EU camp and will sit on the fence until we vote.
1	However, the landscape has changed and the resource that the Scottish National Party highlighted as a jewel in the country's crown doesn't shine anymore. The North Sea oil industry is in dire straits. OPEC statistics show that average oil output in 2013 from the North Sea clocked its lowest level since 1977, and prices have plunged. Scotland depends on the rest of the UK for its pensions, its welfare and for jobs. Leaving the UK would've been horrific.  However, Britain is not in the same boat as Scotland, and we shouldn't treat both referendums the same way. The political and economic situation is far more complex.
1	We are meant to be operating under the bloc's Single Market mechanism as an EU member. The EU describes it as "one territory without any internal borders or other regulatory obstacles to the free movement of goods and services." It's basically meant to stimulate competition and trade, improve efficiency, and helps cut prices. We are meant to operate as one. Basically, it only works if all countries are identical and work as a hive, like the Borg in Star Trek. That sounds like a Utopian ideal, and it has not worked at all. Take a look at the complete schism between the economic growth of the UK, Germany and the rest of the Eurozone.
1	Britain's performance has more in common with the economic recovery in the US than the Eurozone. It doesn't really look like we need the EU. It needs us. Britain is sitting pretty at the moment regardless of the political camp you hail from. Unemployment is just 5.5%, which is pretty much as close to "full employment" as we can get.  Inflation is low, real wages are rising at a solid pace, and more people are able to get on the housing ladder. We are also one of the key financial centres in the world. Now compare it to the unemployment rate in these countries and the rest of the Eurozone as a whole:
1	In Britain, for example, London may generate greater amounts of wealth than certain regions in the country. If somewhere like Nottingham was struggling, the money is redistributed to pay for welfare or prop up the local economy. Infrastructure, like new railway lines, could be installed to link cities and create greater connection for people working or looking to expand business.  In the EU, we don't have this. Just look at Greece and the sorry mess it is. Sure, we lend money and force them to gut their country from the inside out, but a loan is not a re-distribution of wealth. Countries that need to devalue their currency to spur exports can't. The bloc is not a "single" anything.
1	The EU's economy is "shrinking relative to other countries across the globe" and its population is ageing. In 2020, the ratio of working-age people to pensioners in the EU will be 3:1, while in 2050 it'll be 2:1. This is according to a Business for Britain report published in June, which had Mark Littlewood of the Institute of Economic Affairs, John Mills of JML, and fund manager Helena Morrissey of Newton on its editorial board. They added that tax payments to the EU, the level of bureaucracy, and the changing population are all contributing to greater cost for the nation.
1	Of course, being part of a union means we should all technically share that burden and have a say in what laws are enacted, while also making sure others aren't penalised to the advantage of other nations. It shouldn't be all bad. Take a look at Greece again. The country has teetered on the brink of collapse so many times, it might as well jump off the cliff. But it can't because it's stuck with loans it doesn't want, that seem near impossible for it to pay back. The one time it did show some semblance of sovereignty or power was at its referendum on the bailout. The public voted against the extremely harsh (and arguably necessary) conditions in exchange for emergency cash. And we all know how that turned out – an utterly pointless exercise.
1	There are a few things that Britons are getting really tired of, and a growing mountain of examples to show how the UK doesn't really have much of a say in what happens within the bloc. Since 2010, the EU has introduced over 3,500 new laws affecting British business. Business for Britain highlighted in its report in June that the sheer volume of red tape that affects the UK is costing billions.
1	As demonstrated, Britain's economy and society is unique. It doesn't fall into a hive mind of Europe. No country within the European Union does, that's why a Single Market doesn't actually exist. However, the way Brussels has handled the worst refugee crisis in over half a century is not making it easy to bat away concerns over sovereignty and understanding of the different needs of a country.
1	Under EU law, Britain could not prevent a citizen of another member state from coming to live in the UK, and Britons benefited from an equivalent right to live and work anywhere else in the bloc. The result was a huge increase in immigration into Britain, particularly from eastern and southern Europe.
1	Brexiteers argued that leaving the EU would result in an immediate cost saving, as the country would no longer contribute to the EU budget. In 2016, Britain paid in ?13.1bn, but it also received ?4.5bn worth of  spending, said Full Fact, “so the UK’s net contribution was ?8.5bn”.
1	Brexit campaigners proposed several different models for post-EU trade policy. Boris Johnson, for one, favours an arrangement based on Canada’s free trade treaty: “I think we can strike a deal as the Canadians have done based on trade and getting rid of tariffs” and have a “very, very bright future”, he said.
1	Brexit supporters were adamant that a deal to allow continued tariff-free trading would be secured even if the UK left the single market. Britain had a large trade deficit with the EU, they said, and so it would be in Europe’s interest to find a compromise - for goods and financial services. Others suggested that Britain could cut links with Europe and reinvent itself as a Singapore-style economy, free from EU rules and regulations.
1	A deal voted on by parliament would respect the democratic process, being in accordance with both the referendum outcome and parliamentary democracy.
1	The initial referendum was based on limited information about what Brexit would entail. Now that people have a clearer idea of the issues at stake, a confirmatory vote would be appropriate.
1	For Brexiteers, sovereignty was seen as a simple win: even the most ardent Remainers had to admit that EU membership involved giving up some control over domestic affairs. Pro-Brexit Labour MP Kate Hoey said at the time that the EU was “an attempt to replace the democratic power of the people with a permanent administration in the interests of big business”. Those on the right of the Conservative party might have disagreed with her emphasis, but they shared the view that EU institutions drained power from the UK parliament. For Leavers, exiting the EU would allow Britain to re-establish itself as a truly independent nation with connections to the rest of the world.
1	Former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who was in favour of Brexit, said Britain was leaving the “door open” to terrorist attacks by remaining in the EU. “This open border does not allow us to check and control people,” he argued.
1	Leaving the EU and controlling low-end immigration will do that. A local news channel had an investigation in to Brexit and its effect on the agricultural sector. One firm was investing in machinery to replace people. So that's an improvement in productivity, as direct consequence of Brexit, right there.
1	The past two years have been characterised by an outpouring of anti-EU bile by mainly Conservative MPs and their supporters in the media. For the new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to compare the EU with the Soviet Union, was certainly not the worst of the comments. For a large swathe of the Tory Party, the EU was and is the enemy.
1	So why could Brexit be good for the EU?  Despite all its opt outs (euro, Schengen, justice and home affairs) the UK has never felt quite comfortable in the EU and has often blocked attempts, as in defence, to deepen integration. Now the EU has the chance to move forward without using the UK as an alibi. There are many important dossiers from reform of the Eurozone to defence and migration where the EU needs to deepen integration. It now has the chance to move forward without worrying about any British veto. If it can do this then it will demonstrate that the Brits were indeed responsible for the slow pace of integration. But given the many political problems in EU member states one cannot be too optimistic about such a scenario.
1	While the leave campaign succeeded in the referendum, there has been less success in negotiating with the EU. To dissuade other members considering their own withdrawals, the EU have been firm in their approach to the negotiation process so far. Leave supporters are unyielding in their resolve that the referendum result is final, and that the UK must now leave the EU. However, while some on the leave side advocate a hard Brexit – gaining more sovereignty, taking control over immigration and reducing red tape – others are more moderate.
1	In short, in reality, as a result of EU membership, the UK had lost control over its own laws, money and borders in varying degrees. That’s a fact.
1	Brexit provides the golden opportunity for the UK’s economy to revive on the back of a re-balancing away from the EU and export its way round the world.  By extension, the UK’s post-Brexit economic renaissance could well be also a catalyst and impetus in the reinvigoration and renewal of the Commonwealth’s sense of purpose in the world.
1	The UK could then assume her rightful place in the world once again, as an outward-looking and self-confident nation. She can start harnessing her soft power and diplomatic prestige in service of the regained or newly found role in the world without the constraints and liabilities of EU membership.
-1	The prospect of an abrupt departure from the EU looms large. I do try to keep up with what different unions or Norway deals or cliff-edges might mean, but what I’m really worried about is what it will do to holidays.
-1	If there is a silver lining to all this, it might be a new appreciation for other parts of the continent from which we are trying so incompetently to separate ourselves.
-1	Outside the EU, said Remainers, the UK would lose the benefits of free trade with neighbours and reduce its negotiating power with the rest of the world.
-1	This week, a restaurant made headlines after it refused to remove an anti-Brexit message from its receipts despite receiving death threats from Leave voters.
-1	Theresa May's plans for Brexit are mired in doubt after EU leaders cautioned her that unless she presented an alternative to her current proposal, Britain would crash out of the EU without a deal.
-1	Since the Brexit vote, many banks and financial firms have been establishing EU bases to take some staff out of the UK - although most seem likely to maintain the majority of their British operations. Some car-makers have fared less well, but non-Brexit-related factors have also played a part in this gloomy outcome.
-1	Since 2016 the prospectus of the Leavers has changed beyond all recognition. Today, there is no more talk of an extra ?350m for the NHS, .of new trade deals and regained sovereignty, only increasingly dubious reassurances that somehow, everything will be alright.
-1	One of the biggest lies of this whole mess is the idea that we can “get Brexit done” and move on quickly. The big question we face is how we want to spend the next decade. By endlessly talking about Brexit or by confronting all of the other challenges we face as a country from the NHS to climate change?
-1	For Remainers, it would result in the country giving up its influence in Europe, turning back the clock and retreating from the global power networks of the 21st century. To them, EU membership involved a worthwhile exchange of sovereignty for influence: in return for agreeing to abide by EU rules, they said, Britain had a seat around the negotiating table and its voice was amplified on the world stage as a result.
-1	“The truth is that pulling up the drawbridge and quitting the EU will not enhance our national sovereignty,” said Labour’s Hilary Benn, before the referendum. “All it would do is to weaken it by taking away our power to influence events in an ever more complex and interdependent world.” Nor, said Remainers, would UK sovereignty be absolute outside the EU: the British government would still be bound by membership of NATO, the UN, the WTO and various treaties and agreements with other nations.
-1	Libération, too, noted the “peaceful and good-natured” mood. “And what if, after all, life was simpler than Brexit?” the paper asked. “What if it was a poster that made thousands laugh, a picnic on a crowded patch of grass, dogs and babies draped in European flags, and a carnival atmosphere on a Saturday in spring?”
-1	Although Brexit would bring some clear-cut advantages, said The Economist, the UK might well find itself “a scratchy outsider with somewhat limited access to the single market, almost no influence and few friends”.
-1	Reduced immigration could also cause damaging skills shortages in the UK workforce, said Remainers, as well as dampen demand for goods and services. Writing for the London School of Economics, Professor Adrian Favell said limiting freedom of movement would deter the “brightest and the best” of the continent from coming to Britain.
-1	“The Tory backbenches loathed it. The Democratic Unionists hated it. The opposition Labour Party opposed it,” says the US newspaper. “Brexiteers said it would keep Britain forever shackled to the EU, in vassalage, as Johnson put it. Remainers complained that it would introduce too much economic risk with too little reward.”
-1	But above all, the paper concluded: “Brexit was, for her, a way to control immigration. This was a red line that ruled out other options in the negotiations and led, inevitably, to the present impasse.”
-1	Michael Fallon, who was defence secretary at the time, said the UK benefited from being part of the EU, as well as NATO and the UN. “It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism,” he said. “We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism.”
-1	Moreover the negotiations of Brexit with the European Union are not going as well as many initially predicted. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the European Union announced on 20 November 2017 that if the UK is to abandon EU rules and regulation a post-Brexit agreement will be very complicated.
-1	A recent study at the London School of Economics on the impacts of Brexit at a local level, show that there will be few winners and many losers and that the effects will be highly asymmetric across the UK.
-1	Similarly unpredictable are the effects that leaving the EU could have on the United Kingdom itself. The different types of nationalism and national identities coexisting in the UK may be exacerbated in the Brexit process. In addition to economic, social, and diplomatic implications, a Brexit can destabilize the territorial configuration and even disintegrate the UK.
-1	In fact, the majority of Scots and Northern Irish people voted to stay in the EU. Wales backed the leave option, but only by a small margin. This has led to the prospect that an exit from the EU could end up with the United Kingdom breaking up.
-1	The Nationalists would not be willing to continue accepting a Union with a with a weakened England outside Europe. Some experts have suggested that Brexit may endanger the Good Friday Agreements and re-open a border dispute with Ireland and undermine British position vis-a-vis the conflict with Spain on Gibraltar sovereignty.
-1	Spillover effect: Europe may get hit by the Brexit scenario. A loss of trust from investors in Europe could be one of the negative consequences of Brexit. Many Europeans would accuse the British government of being irresponsible for having triggered an European crisis and this could damage the image of the United Kingdom abroad.
-1	Brexit would eliminate protections of equal pay, maternity leave, and safe workplaces. The idea that Britain would give up their push toward more equality for women seems low, even if a no-deal Brexit ends up happening. The European Union has spent much of their time bringing the country along, often reluctantly, to offer equality benefits to women and minority populations. Once the divorce happens, then there wouldn’t be the same protections against discrimination as there are now in the international courts.
-1	We have seen what misogyny and populism can do to the United States and how it gains national acceptance. This issue could impact Britain more than anyone could ever predict. The various directives that could be reversed with Brexit include the following.Four weeks of guaranteed annual leave for workers.Regulated break times and working hours that prevent more than 48 hours of labor per week.Four months of paid parental leave, including additional protections for workers who are pregnant.Worker protections that apply when businesses change ownership.
-1	Brexit would change the perspective of Britain being the “gateway” to Europe. One of the reasons that Britain decided to avoid the eurozone was that the strength of its currency was higher. It continues to be the most valuable currency trading right now, with 1 GBP equally 1.31 USD and 1.14 Euro. Tax revenues will drop when the country separates itself from Europe because banks would move their headquarters back into the membership block. Banks in the United States would no longer do business in the country when dealing with Europe either, which could impact their economy in unpredictable ways. There would no longer be a free passport across the continent for financial firms to enjoy.
-1	Brexit could create a labor shortage. Although a drop in the immigration rates would create more job availability for everyone who stayed in the country, Brexit does offer the potential to create labor shortages as well. Should this disadvantage occur, then it could hold back the potential for economic growth within the country. A decline in population would also likely reduce the demand for goods and services sold domestically. Skill shortages could hurt specific sectors of the economy as well.
-1	Brexit could prevent the sharing of intelligence information. Brexit might help Britain find ways to close some vulnerable borders, but it would also limit the information flowing from the European Union and NATO. There could even be a reduction in data coming from the United Nations after the separation takes place. Having access to passenger records, criminal data, and counter-terrorism teams helps to create a safer space for everyone living there. Although many of the bilateral relationships would continue, it will take more effort to get essential information items into the hands of the people who need them the most.
-1	Brexit could reduce the amount of foreign direct investment that Britain receives. By joining together in the European Union, the 28 members (before Brexit) form 25% of the global GDP. To give that figure some perspective, the United States currently holds a 15.2% share of the worldwide GDP. As Europe has continued to grow and form relationships, their common bonds have helped to leverage more of the world’s economy. The U.S. represented 40% of the global GDP in 1960. With Britain separating itself from this membership bloc, the impact will be felt first in the amount of foreign direct investment that comes into the economy. In 2012, over ?937 billion was received, with 50% of that related to EU activities. There is a real possibility that the Brexit divorce could cost the country over ?300 billion in FDI almost immediately.
-1	Brexit could still force Britain to be subject to EU laws and regulations. Many who support the idea of Brexit look at Norway as a model for how Britain could have a relationship with the European Union. Although Norway does receive an exception of CAP, it is still subject to the laws and regulations of the membership bloc. That is the price that is paid for having access to the single market of the EU. Britain would likely be paying the same price. It could require the government to continue following the bureaucratic requirements without having the power to influence decisions after the separation completes itself.
-1	Brexit could reverse the protections of food, health, and animal rights. Most of the food standards that are in place in Britain right now originate in the European Union. That gives Britons comfort in knowing that many of the potentially harmful additives which are put into food products around the world are not in what they eat. That’s why an ingredient list from items made in Europe is much shorter than for a comparable one produced in the United States. The European Union also banned animal testing (with some exemptions) across the entire membership bloc in 2012. This measure included animal welfare standards that could shift once Brexit begins its journey forward.
-1	Brexit could force Brits living in EU member states to move back home. Because of the border issues created by Brexit, there would be a separation between Britain and the remaining 27 members. More than 1.4 million people from the country have taken advantage of the travel and work agreements which exist in the European Union. Once this separation takes place, their status will become questionable instantly. They may be required to apply for a work visa, seek citizenship, or even move back home to avoid a potential conflict with their status. The UK would also lose the strength which comes when you are part of a diverse national and international culture.
-1	Brexit would create more high-skill job openings that would remain unfilled. When you compare the educational data of Britain with that of the remaining European Union members, then employers will see that EU workers tend to be better educated. About 32% of people living in the EU-27 (excluding Britain) have a university degree, compared to the 21% of citizens in the UK. People moving into Britain from Europe have contributed 34% more financially to the nation than they cost in required supports.
-1	Brexit could cause Britain to lose the U.S. as a primary trading partner. The United States and Europe have an on-again, off-again relationship with the creation of a free-trade zone between the two entities. They combined make up over 40% of the global GDP. If Britain separates itself from the EU, then it would lose the benefits of this trade arrangement. Although they could set up their own agreements, Britain wouldn’t have the same leverage to ask for benefits that help domestically as they would if they were part of the membership block.
-1	Brexit would end access to the regulation cost guarantees that Europe provides. Consumers benefit from the regulations that limit costs throughout Europe for specific products and services. Since 2015, consumers using cellular phones and data receive the same price for services in one of the EU-28 states as they do back at home. This structure prevents the unexpected costs from roaming. These costs might rise on the day that the separation occurs. There are additional travel cost concerns to consider as well, such as airline tickets, hotel bookings, and even the price of fuel.
-1	Brexit could cause household energy bills to rise. Although the average household would save about ?1,000 from unnecessary regulations when Brexit is finalized, they’ll lose some of that savings by paying for higher heating and cooling prices. The energy costs could increase by ?500 million or more in the years afterward because the UK would no longer be able to negotiate pricing on the same scale. There would be concerns with air pollutants and their impact on the environment. These costs could be enough to make some investors look for other options instead of staying in Britain with their money.
-1	Brexit may shift the educational diversity found in the country today. Students from the European Union are eligible to pay the same tuition and fees as Britons under the regulations of the EU. They can apply for the same financial supports when attending university in the UK as well. Once the separation is complete, then it would be up to the British government to determine how the costs for students from Europe would be regulated. It would also impact access to the Erasmus program that allows over 200,000 students and 20,000 staff to spend time abroad as part of their studies.
-1	It is easier for the UK media to get away with publishing untruths and half-truths about the EU because the British public knows less about it than do citizens of any other country bar Latvia. Asked by pollsters whether three simple statements about the EU were true or false only 28% of Brits answered correctly. Indeed, one of the most revealing signs of British voters’ ignorance was the fact that the most-searched EU question on Google on 24 June was “What does it mean to leave the EU”, followed by “What is the EU?”
-1	The article is typical of lazy, error- strewn British reporting about the EU. For a start, it refers to a “new directive” when this was a draft text. Second, “bureaucrats” don’t make EU laws – the Commission proposes them and the European Parliament and Council of the EU pass them. So there was no “new directive” and certainly no “ban” – the Commission merely recommended children under eight be accompanied by an adult when blowing up balloons in case they choked.
-1	However, the northeast is a key part of British production, particularly in the automotive sector, and with six ports facing the EU, the region has around 60 percent of its trade with Europe. It will lose the most to the Brexit agreement, where the UK deviates from the EU because of the resulting tariffs and the delays that additional paperwork would take place for very precise, timely businesses. Goods can pass through Europe several times before they become finished products - and currently do not require any additional paperwork other than invoicing.
-1	UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future. British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits.
-1	The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services. It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy. There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU. Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends. If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends.
-1	 It won't be possible for some suspected criminals to be brought back to the UK if they flee to Germany. Germany's constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, unless it's to another EU country. "This exception cannot apply any more after the UK has left EU," a spokesman from the German Federal Ministry of Justice told BBC News. It's unclear if the same restrictions will apply to other countries. Slovenia, for example, says the situation is complicated, while the European Commission was unable to provide comment. The UK Home Office says the European Arrest Warrant will continue to apply during the transition period. (That means Germany will be able to extradite non-German citizens.) However, it adds that if a country's laws prevent extradition to the UK it "will be expected to take over the trial or sentence of the person concerned".
-1	The dramatic pictures emerged as the Tories were accused of being in referendum chaos over border controls. George Osborne insisted there would be no change to European Union rules on freedom of movement.
-1	This would not spell the end of Brexit. The UK would still need to negotiate trade deals with European and global partners (in a much weakened position) and replace EU legislation with domestic legislation. Adjusting to life outside the EU would take years, if not decades.
-1	Some of those who voted for Johnson’s deal at the second reading made it clear that they did so not to support the legislation but to amend it. Major amendments proposed at the subsequent stages of the process could result in a bill that cannot garner a majority from any side, effectively taking the government back to square one.
-1	The EU is a single market in which imports and exports between member states are exempt from tariffs and other barriers. Services, including financial services, can also be offered without restriction across the continent. The consequences of Brexit for businesses that took advantage of these freedoms was always a matter of debate and conjecture.
-1	 Many voters don’t want to cast their votes solely on the basis of their view on Brexit. There are many other issues at stake in an election, including all other areas of policy, and feelings about the respective party leaders. Voters might feel forced to choose between a party with whom they agree on Brexit, and a party with whom they agree on other things. This further muddies the waters for anyone hoping for a clear Brexit mandate following the election.
-1	Outside the EU, said Remainers, the UK would lose the benefits of free trade with neighbours and reduce its negotiating power with the rest of the world. Brexiteers, meanwhile, said the UK could compensate for those disadvantages by establishing its own trade agreements - and that most small and medium-sized firms, which have never traded overseas, would be freed of the regulatory burden that comes with EU membership.
-1	The country is still deeply divided. Any outcome would likely provide only a slender mandate for the victorious side, while remaining fiercely contested by the losing side.
-1	Pro-Europeans argued that the UK’s status as one of the world’s biggest financial centres would be diminished if the City of London was no longer seen as a gateway to the EU for the likes of US banks. They also said financial firms based in the UK would lose “passporting” rights to work freely across the continent.
-1	Business for New Europe said tax revenues would drop if companies carrying out large amounts of business with Europe - particularly banks - moved their headquarters back into the EU. Fears that carmakers could scale back or even end production in the UK if vehicles could no longer be exported tax-free to Europe were underlined by BMW’s decision, in 2016, to remind its UK employees at Rolls-Royce and Mini of the “significant benefit” EU membership conferred.
-1	Many people would still be casting their votes from a position of relative ignorance. Few people have actually read the withdrawal agreement and most voters don’t appreciate that the deal is only the first stage of a protracted negotiation process. There is also the threat of misinformation. Both sides were accused of lying during the 2016 referendum and it would be naïve to assume more scrupulous behaviour this time around.
-1	 As neither of the largest political parties would contest an election on a platform of revoking article 50, the only way to achieve a mandate for this would be via a referendum. There is no guarantee that this outcome would gain popular support.
-1	The EU is a single market in which imports and exports between member states are exempt from tariffs and other barriers. Services, including financial services, can also be offered without restriction across the continent. The consequences of Brexit for businesses that took advantage of these freedoms was always a matter of debate and conjecture.

They also said financial firms based in the UK would lose “passporting” rights to work freely across the continent.
-1	Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice. Prices may also increase "which could impact vulnerable groups". Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply.
-1	After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow a different process, involving a number of vet's tests. The process could take up to four months.
-1	 Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there are likely to be significant price rises for businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms "exit" the energy market, "exacerbating" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which said the UK could be "more vulnerable to supply shortages in the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
-1	For Remainers, it would result in the country giving up its influence in Europe, turning back the clock and retreating from the global power networks of the 21st century. To them, EU membership involved a worthwhile exchange of sovereignty for influence: in return for agreeing to abide by EU rules, they said, Britain had a seat around the negotiating table and its voice was amplified on the world stage as a result. “The truth is that pulling up the drawbridge and quitting the EU will not enhance our national sovereignty,” said Labour’s Hilary Benn, before the referendum. “All it would do is to weaken it by taking away our power to influence events in an ever more complex and interdependent world.” Nor, said Remainers, would UK sovereignty be absolute outside the EU: the British government would still be bound by membership of NATO, the UN, the WTO and various treaties and agreements with other nations.
-1	 Pro-EU campaigners put economic security at the heart of their message, claiming three million jobs would be lost if Britain voted to leave. But Brexiteers branded the campaign “Project Fear”, dismissing it as a collection of gloomy fantasies.Those two simple positions masked a complex debate about economic forecasts and employment rates, which intersected with arguments about trade policy and migration. Take immigration, for example. Fewer people coming to the country would mean less competition for jobs among those who remained and, potentially, higher wages - a point conceded by Stuart Rose, leader of the pro-Remain Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. “But that is not necessarily a good thing,” Rose said, as labour shortages and rising wage bills could reduce economic competitiveness and growth.
-1	Reduced immigration could also cause damaging skills shortages in the UK workforce, said Remainers, as well as dampen demand for goods and services. Writing for the London School of Economics, Professor Adrian Favell said limiting freedom of movement would deter the “brightest and the best” of the continent from coming to Britain. Brexiteers, meanwhile, said Britain could tailor its post-Brexit immigration policy to the needs of the economy.
-1	In addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.
-1	 However, several senior military figures, including former chiefs of defence staff Lord Bramall and Jock Stirrup, argued the opposite. In a letter released by No 10 during the campaign, they said the EU was an “increasingly important pillar of our security”, especially at a time of instability in the Middle East and in the face of “resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression”.
-1	 Since the Brexit vote, the Government has said it will work to maintain security relationships with the EU. “In today’s uncertain world we need that shared strength more than ever,” said Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, in May 2018. “I hope for a comprehensive and enduring agreement that tackles obstacles and allows professionals to get on with the job together.”
-1	Though unsuccessful in garnering enough votes in the referendum, the remain camp have continued to advocate for a close relationship with the EU in the form of a departure from the EU with a deal in place. The arguments for remaining in the EU focus on the benefits of being part of a wider union, and the security and favourable trading relationship made possible through EU membership.
0	A legal appeal to determine whether Britain alone can change its mind about leaving the European Union (EU) should be given consideration by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), Scotland's highest court has ruled.
0	On Saturday at noon, I will join hundreds of thousands of people for one of the biggest and most important protests our country has ever seen. If you care about our country, its future and its place in the world, I urge you to join us.
0	“Historic demonstration in London for a second vote,” was Le Monde’s headline, above an extensive report from its London correspondent noting that more than a million people had taken to the streets “in a country where protest is not the norm”.
0	It remains unclear how Brexit will affect the jobs market. Economic growth has slowed since the referendum, but employment remains high - and what happens next will depend largely on what sort of trading relationship the UK seeks with the EU and the rest of the world, and what they say in response. “Figures from the early 2000s suggest around three million jobs are linked to trade with the European Union”, says Full Fact, but “they don’t say they are dependent on the UK being an EU member”. If trade falls, and the slack is not picked up elsewhere, then some of those jobs will be lost - but that is not a foregone conclusion.
0	Brexit continues to be a hot political issue months after the referendum. Although the negotiations with the European Union seem to have seen some progress lately, there are are still many uncertainties about the future of the UK outside the Europe. Many claim that this decision may have not only important economic impacts, but it could also have deeper domestic political consequences. Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are requesting a second independence referendum in Scotland.
0	The study also finds stark differences in the tone of coverage in different countries. In general, media in Central and Eastern Europe focus more on problems experienced with, and protests against, migrants and refugees. Media in Western European emphasize the situation of migrants and refugees, and the help provided to them. Western European media in our sample also quoted many more (non-migrant) speakers with positive attitudes towards migrants and refugees than media in Central and Eastern Europe. A pattern also emerges when we contrast data for left-liberal media and media with a more conservative profile: liberal-left media quoted more speakers with a positive attitude, and reported considerably more on help for and the situation of migrants and refugees.
0	The way in which the issue of Brexit has divided British society into opposing camps was perfectly captured by the front pages of two newspapers, the Guardian and the Daily Mail, on 31 January. Both front pages featured an illustration of the white cliffs of Dover, often seen as forming a symbolic guard against invasions from continental Europe. However, this iconic image was treated in a very different way by both papers.
0	A strong theme was that Brexit highlighted problems within the EU. However the majority view, across all political opinions, was that it should be reformed rather than be allowed to fail. Most also agreed the EU would be worse off without Britain (81 articles, compared to 14). One Hungarian newspaper argued the EU was only a “rump” without the United Kingdom. Only one country, Russia, had more positive than negative articles about Brexit.
0	Asking people about their views on immigration is not always straightforward. Definitions and categories are a particular problem: individual respondents and survey organisations may have different ideas of who ‘immigrants’ are. Question wording matters: when people are asked, for example, about whether immigration ought to be reduced, the UK looks rather negative compared to other countries. However, it looks more favourable based on whether people feel that immigration makes the country a better or worse place to live. It is always a good idea to take a holistic approach, rather than relying on just one or two survey questions.
0	Since the Brexit vote, many banks and financial firms have been establishing EU bases to take some staff out of the UK - although most seem likely to maintain the majority of their British operations. Some car-makers have fared less well, but non-Brexit-related factors have also played a part in this gloomy outcome.
0	Many Remainers acknowledged that the pace of immigration had led to some difficulties with housing and service provision, but said the net effect had been overwhelmingly positive. By contrast, Brexiteers said Britain should “regain control” of its borders. Most wanted a substantial cut in immigration, although some said it was less about numbers than the principle of national sovereignty.
0	It remains unclear how Brexit will affect the jobs market. Economic growth has slowed since the referendum, but employment remains high - and what happens next will depend largely on what sort of trading relationship the UK seeks with the EU and the rest of the world, and what they say in response.
0	As a convinced pro-European Brit I never thought I would suggest that the UK needs a break from the EU. But the truth is there is an anti-EU virus in the British body politic that can only be cured by a period in the wilderness. No one can judge whether this will be 5, 10 or 15 years but hopefully it will lead to a new generation of politicians free from the virus and the UK can rejoin the EU and help make it stronger.
0	And if the lockdown lasts into early summer, a similarly big ideological leap of imagination looms over Brexit. For the first time, according to a YouGov poll, a narrow majority of Britons now want to extend the transition beyond December, suggesting the last thing many voters want right now is another economic shock. For now, Boris Johnson’s administration is clinging to the pretence that a complex Brexit deal can still somehow be negotiated in the middle of a national emergency that has put the prime minister in intensive care. But reality surely dictates that the timetable can’t hold.
0	The crunch time for deciding whether or not to extend the timetable is June, by which time official growth and employment statistics should finally be catching up with the damage now happening under all our noses. If some ministers currently fear a public backlash by admitting Brexit might have to be delayed, by summer the idea of ploughing on regardless may be more likely to trigger a mutiny.
0	Familiar faces such as Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe are among the UK's 73 MEPs who will automatically lose their seats in the European Parliament.  That's because, at the moment of Brexit, the UK will leave all of the EU's political institutions and agencies.  However, in addition to the UK following EU rules during the transition period, the European Court of Justice will continue to have the final say over legal disputes.
0	No more EU summits  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to be specially invited if he wants to join other leaders at EU Council summits in the future.  British ministers will also no longer attend regular EU meetings that decide things such as fishing limits.
0	We will be hearing a lot about trade  The UK will be able to start talking to countries around the world about setting new rules for buying and selling goods and services.  It has not been allowed to hold formal trade negotiations with countries like the US and Australia while it remained an EU member. Brexit supporters argue that having the freedom to set its own trade policy will boost the UK's economy.  There's also a lot to be discussed with the EU.
0	Blue passports will be making a return, more than 30 years after they were replaced by the current burgundy design.  Announcing the change in 2017, then Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, praised the return to the "iconic" blue-and-gold design, first used in 1921.  The new colour will be phased in over a number of months, with all new passports issued in blue by the middle of the year.  Existing burgundy passports will continue to be valid.
0	The team that handled the UK-EU negotiations and no-deal preparations will disband on Brexit day.  The Department for Exiting the European Union was set up by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016.  For the upcoming talks, the UK's negotiating team will be based in Downing Street.
0	Flights, boats and trains will operate as usual.  When it comes to passport control, during the transition period, UK nationals will still be allowed to queue in the areas reserved for EU arrivals only.
-1	Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there are likely to be significant price rises for businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns.

0	On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its intention to leave the European Union, in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The European Commission’s Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom (UKTF) coordinates the work on all strategic, operational, legal and financial issues related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal and its future relationship with the European Union. Michel Barnier is the Head of this Task Force.
0	European media follow the Brexit debate closely, but appear unconcerned about the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.  A study of media coverage over the past six months reveals those living outside the UK do not believe Brexit will drive the EU apart. It also found European Brexit reporting was predominantly fact-based. Most (78%) analysed news items took no position in relation to Brexit. Only 22% conveyed a clear opinion.  These are preliminary findings of a comparative content analysis of media coverage in eight European countries.
0	Brexit is the nickname for "British exit" from the European Union. The U.K. left the EU on Jan. 31, 2020.  The Brexit process began on June 23, 2016 when the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. The residents decided that the benefits of belonging to the unified monetary body no longer outweighed the costs of free movement of immigration. The vote was 17.4 million in favor of leaving versus 15.1 million who voted to remain.
-1	The more distant we get from the EU the more likely it is that we will get trading barriers, and that has, all things being equal, negative economic consequences.
1	That said, Barnard can  imagine a future where, in 10 years' time, "we have left the EU and poverty has been radically reduced" through appropriate government intervention, and where the time freed up from the Brexit process can be fully focused on "domestic priorities".
0	Scotland and Northern Ireland voted "remain" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, as opposed to leave-voting England and Wales.
0	The first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU.  But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  Time is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate - all the remaining 27 member states and the European Parliament have to be in agreement. That means formal talks might only begin in March.  The government has ruled out any form of extension to the transition period.  If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU.
1	Taking advantage of Brexit  Despite its controversy, a positive economic consequence of Brexit for the UK is it gives the country the independence to renegotiate new trade agreements with third countries. This includes Indonesia.  After Brexit, the UK is likely to form other trade agreements with third countries outside the EU, including Indonesia, under a no-deal scenario.  In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the “divorce” process. This means the UK can regain regulatory sovereignty from overly burdensome EU trade regulations. EU social and employment laws come with a significant cost to the UK economy – 22 of the 100 costliest EU-derived regulations fall into this category and they are particularly burdensome for small businesses.  Without these burdens, the UK can renegotiate its deals with other countries, including Indonesia.  The UK is not Indonesia’s main trade partner. It ranks 17th in the list of Indonesia’s export destinations.  Indonesian goods exports to the UK consist of footwear (16.3%) wood and wood products (9.7%), apparel (7.7%), machinery and electrical equipment (6.0% ), furniture (5%), paper (5%) and other products.  Meanwhile, Indonesia imports a large proportion of high-technology products from the UK such as machinery with a 15.3% share of Indonesia’s total imports.  The post-Brexit era should serve as a basis for a more open and profitable bilateral relation between the two countries.
1	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically. For instance, most people in northern Europe see southern Europe as a place to go to play, not to do business and partner. Then there was Merkel's boneheaded decision to let immigrants in, no questions asked. Finally, there was the time-frame: people on both sides of the Pond believe that their governments have forgotten the citizens for whom they work. The cure for all three of those problems is to throw the b**tards out. Brexit is just the leading edge of what lies ahead.
-1	I think that BREXIT is not good for both the Britain and EU. The Britain should play a more positive role as Germany did.
-1	Because of global technology, economy and problems, we need global cooperation and coordination.  Local chauvinism is NEVER an acceptable response!
-1	I think the EU started to feel the heat after the unification of the currencies into the Euro which brought with it lots of economic problems and complexities. Before that, the union was doing okay in my opinion. However, I still think that all countries of the world should be open to and trade with all countries for the benefit and prosperity of all.
1	I think that EU should not be all about Economy. The main problem with actual EU is that is an economic Giant and a political Dorf. It is very significative that precisely Great Britain, one of the first promotors of the idea of an Unified Europe, becomes the first to leave the group. On the other side, I think Great Britain will continue to assume a preponderant role in World Economy.
1	Brexit, , while moderately painful to both member's and western economies, at least in the short run, will enable the world economy to better weather the eventual and inevitable collapse of the entire EU structure. Former Czech President Vaclav Klaus has been predicting this for many years,  and every year his data grow more robust.
1	The UK was never really the same as other European countries. You still needed a passport and go through customs. To me I am happy they are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
-1	It is not the EU that is destined to collapse, but the UK, as Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland secede from the UK to apply independently to the EU. No more UK. No more Great Britain. No more Britain, Just little England drifting away, free at last, just like some of the homeless zombies most of us have encountered in our downtowns  who see themselves as so much freer than the rest of us, slaves to jobs, cars, families, bills and mortgages.
-1	Instead of trading and cooperating with the other parts of the world, Europe wanted to close its doors on itself. Now, it is losing its members due to economical issues ... and I  think Britain's exit is just a start.
0	Globalization and its consequences, then, might provide an explanation of Brexit, in part. And then there is Scotland. Clearly, no single explanation can capture the complexities of the European Union, the U.K. within it, the politics within the U.K. and the insinuation of globalization within those discourses and actions. But to speak about the vote purely in national or regional terms is to miss an important element in the transformation of political discourse globally.  The pressures and realities that fracture British society, especially in England are present in all states--even the United States and China are not immune.  It affects developing states hardest, precisely because the fractures of globalization are more apparent in the breakup of the unity of the political structures of those states,  But make no mistake, those fractures and its consequences will be felt in even the most developed states in the coming decade.  The Brexit vote is a harbinger of more complex politics in the decade to come.
0	The EU is not a closed bloc Ahmed. It trades with and has agreements with the Middle East and North Africa, the rest of Africa, the Pacific/Caribbean etc. It has circles of cooperation all over the world. The UK  will be like Norway I think- partly in the bloc but unable to influence its decisions. It was never in the bloc entirely, true,  but at least its weight ensured some balancing of Germany and France. Now Germany and France will have to bear the burden of weaker members and that makes the bloc fragile as well as too large and too ambitious. Despite the corruption and waste within the EU  it reduced cultural barriers at least for the educated;  now in the teeming poor areas  nationalism is unleashed, and with it xenophobia.
1	The United Kingdom was never part of Schengen nor was it part of the Euro.  Now it appears that, although Brits have voted to leave the EU, the UK might still have a customs union with the EU--identical or very similar to what it had when it was in.  When you look at the kind of association that the EU has with Norway or Switzerland, you wonder what good it is to be part of the EU, especially if you can avoid the costs linked to being a member of the euro zone.
-1	Hello again Ahmed- the EU bailed out Greece several times, largely because too many evade their taxes there.    Germany and the UK are the main  paymasters of the bloc and now the 2nd richest will no longer help. That is a real worry in much of the EU because poverty breeds xenophobia and fascism as we all know.
-1	Dear Cornel, you are looking at BREXIT and USEXIT as if they were normal democratic outcomes, they are extreme democratic outcomes. Normal democratic outcomes tend toward balanced stability/integration.... Extreme democratic outcomes tend towards full chaos aimed at protection of the ruling minority and the destruction of majority rule based institutions, local and global, and to the destruction of majority rule granted minority rights...Once BREXIT is formal it will move in the direction that USEXIT has moved so understanding the nature of extreme democratic outcomes is vital for EU and all countries under majority rule based democracies,,,, Take the time to read the paper above and you may be able to see why the coming of BREXIT and USEXIT lead huge surprises... Have a nice day!
1	You're entitled to your view, of course, Lam. But that view and $3USD will get you a latte at Starbucks. I hope your PhD studies will include a balanced perspective of the history of Europe, 1939 - present. That is obviously missing in your education so far. The views of those on the winning side of wars--the U.S., the U.K., etc.--about how the world works, or should work, tend to differ in major ways from those on the losing side, including Germany. In fact, the Germans, in the guise of their prime minister, Ms. Merkel, are single-handedly responsible for the transformation of much of Europe by Muslim refugees who will mostly refuse to assimilate and embrace European institutions of tolerance, education, equality of women, etc. In fact, having talked with a number of Germans at a conference in Dusseldorf several years ago about the prospect of conflict in Europe, my wife and I came away dumbfounded by the degree to which their country's role in World War II still hangs over them like a wet blanket. Those to whom we spoke seemed willing to do about anything to avoid any conflict of any kind. We suspect that's why Merkel did nothing when the hordes of Muslim refugees from the Middle East, esp. Syria, fled through Turkey into and through Germany several years ago.
-1	The wind seems to be in the sails of campaigners looking to keep Britain in the EU as, for the first time in the Brexit crisis, they see signs of the public mood shifting in their favour.  Hundreds of thousands marched in support of EU membership last weekend, and a petition calling for article 50 to be revoked, reversing Brexit, secured almost 6m signatures in 10 days. Meanwhile, Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement was voted down for a third time in the House of Commons on Friday, and a second-referendum proposal was one of the most popular options in the “indicative vote” process developed by MPs to gauge support for ways to break the deadlock. A second referendum has never looked nearer and, polling suggests, Remainers would enter the contest narrowly ahead. A range of polling suggests the public have moved in a pro-EU direction since 2016.
-1	Meanwhile, the concentration of Leave support among older voters puts Brexit campaigners on the wrong side of demographic change. There are other headwinds for Brexiters, too. Concern about immigration, a key driver of voting for Leave in 2016, has declined sharply since the referendum. And voters who were enthusiastic about Brexit in 2016 have become more negative about the deal the government has managed to negotiate.  The Remain advantage is, however, narrow and fragile. There has been very little change in sentiment among those who voted in the referendum, and little evidence that Leave voters have changed their minds. Instead, Brexit partisanship has consolidated and intensified, with Leave and Remain voters increasingly seeing their choice as a core part of their political identity. This makes their views very hard to shift – and those who voted last time are more certain to turn out again than the former abstainers and new voters driving Remain’s current polling leads.
0	A second referendum would also be divisive. While majorities back the idea when it is presented as an undefined “people’s vote”, support drops sharply if voters are told that Remain would be one of the options on the ballot paper. A large majority of Leave voters oppose the idea once this is made clear, and even among Remain voters enthusiasm for a re-run of the 2016 vote is not overwhelming.
-1	Brexit's biggest disadvantage is its damage to the U.K.'s economic growth. Most of this has been due to the uncertainty surrounding the final outcome.  Uncertainty over Brexit slowed the U.K.'s growth from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2018.9﻿ The U.K. government estimated that Brexit would lower the U.K.’s growth by 6.7% over 15 years. That’s if there is a trade agreement but restrictions on immigration.10﻿  The British pound fell from $1.48 on the day of the referendum to $1.36 the next day. That helps exports but increases the prices of imports. The pound may strengthen once a deal is approved, depending on the trade terms.
-1	Brexit would eliminate Britain's tariff-free trade status with the other EU members. Tariffs would raise the cost of exports. That would hurt U.K. exporters as their goods become more expensive in Europe. Some of that pain would be offset by a weaker pound.  Tariffs would also increase the prices of imports into the U.K. More than one-third of its imports comes from the EU.  ﻿ Higher import prices would create inflation and lower the standard of living for U.K. residents. The U.K. is already vulnerable because heat waves and droughts caused by global warming have reduced local food production.
-1	The U.K. would lose the advantages of the EU’s state-of-the-art technologies. The EU grants these to its members in environmental protection, research and development, and energy.14﻿ Practitioners would lose the ability to operate in all member countries. It could raise the cost of airfares, the internet, and even phone services.
-1	Brexit would hurt Britain's younger workers. Germany is projected to have a labor shortage of 3 million skilled workers by 2030. Those jobs will no longer be as readily available to the U.K.'s workers after Brexit.  Employers are having a harder time finding applicants.  ﻿ One reason is that the number of EU-born workers fell by 95% in 2017. This has hit the low-skilled and medium-skilled occupations the most.
-1	Northern Ireland would remain with the United Kingdom. The Republic of Ireland, with which it shares a border, would stay a part of the EU. Johnson's plan avoided a customs border between the two Irish countries.  A customs border could have reignited The Troubles. It was a 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between mainly Catholic Irish nationalists and pro-British Protestants. In 1998, it ended with the promise of no border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. A customs border would have forced 9,500 commuters to go through customs on their way to and from work and school. Brexit would also affect the 2,100 workers who commute to Great Britain.
-1	Brexit has already depressed growth in The City, the U.K.'s financial center. Growth was only 1.4% in 2018 and was close to zero in 2019. Brexit has diminished business investment by 11%.  International companies would no longer use London as an English-speaking entry into the EU economy. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley have already switched 10% of their clients. Bank of America has transferred 100 bankers to its Dublin office and 400 to Paris.
0	In 2015, the Conservative Party called for the referendum.  Most of the pro-Brexit voters were older, working-class residents of England's countryside. They were afraid of the free movement of immigrants and refugees. They claimed citizens of poorer countries were taking jobs and benefits.  Small businesses were frustrated by EU fees. Others felt leaving the EU would create jobs. Many felt the U.K. paid more into the EU that it received.  Those who voted to stay lived in London, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. They liked free trade with the EU. They claimed most EU immigrants were young and eager to work. Most felt that leaving the EU would damage the U.K.’s global status.
0	A Brexit, or British exit, is what will happen now that the people of Britain have voted for the UK to leave the European Union. The Brexit campaign won an in-out referendum of EU membership which took place on June 23, 2016.
0	Britain has rejected a European Union demand for an office in Northern Ireland to ensure the UK keeps its promises under the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.  EU sources said Britain feared that the office, which would house customs and veterinary staff, would become a permanent base for EU checks and controls. That is seen as an infringement of UK sovereignty.  The European Commission wants to ensure that the agreement to carry out customs checks on goods and animals travelling from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea is respected.  The deal removed the need for checks on the Irish border with EU member Ireland. It replaced the controversial border 'backstop' plan and paved the way for the withdrawal agreement to finally be ratified by the House of Commons and Brexit on January 31
1	You are completely missing the point. “Whose” regulations they are is very important because it determines whose courts adjudicate cases.  If they are “EU” regulations, then UK cases will all have to be tried in EU Courts, because only EU Courts can say what “EU” regulations really mean. And that would be true even if, for example, a UK passenger was suing a UK airline. Nor could Parliament have any power over the regulations, because then an ex-member state would be making modifications to EU law – a pretty obvious nonsense.  On the other hand, if they are UK regulations, then even if, temporarily, the wording is similar to EU wording, UK Courts will have jurisdiction, and over time Parliament can decide when and how that wording should be modified.
-1	While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.  The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are "particularly vulnerable" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says.
1	Johnson repeatedly insisted that spending increases are only feasible once Brexit is secured, and sought to portray the choice facing British voters as one between "out and out, retrograde and destructive socialism" and "sensible One Nation Conservatism."
-1	That ever-useful distinction between ‘ideologues’ (crudely, those who put ideas before people, whatever their motives) and ‘pragmatists’ (those who put people’s needs before ideas) seems nowhere more relevant than in Britain today. The UK has proved a perfect environment for ideologues whose chief idea – Brexit – reflects (but only exacerbates) the country’s deep problems: a British exceptionalism deriving from an imperial past; an English-oriented ‘unionism’ hostile to the ‘Celtic fringe’; and a traditional English class-based hostility to social equality and modern democratic government.  Brexit is a backward-looking, aggressive English nationalist ideology whose irrationality and irresponsibility spawn intolerance, racism and xenophobia. It demonises the EU and its citizens as an inimical ‘other,’ culpable for British ills, while tearing up more than 40 years of social, economic and political collaboration with the EEC/EU. Shamefully, in England these ideas, even though they curtail the rights and freedoms of the UK’s own citizens, have been met with singular success among a large minority. Backed by electoral abuses, manipulation of the Internet, a rightwing print media and a cowed BBC, they have successfully poisoned political debate, preying on public ignorance, political disenchantment and economic resentment.
1	Considering we've contributed something like 1/2 trillion pounds to the EU I doubt very much it has cost anything like that.
0	Out of interest, the FSB has been surveying small & medium enterprises on this topic since the referendum. They could provide some info. However, I suspect that a lot of the answers are pure conjecture. Nobody can predict, accurately, what the overall effect will be, until the transition period is finished and all the deals have been made.  My advice to any small business that foresees a problem is to contact the FSB and the government to express your concerns. Don't simply whinge about it.
-1	Trade barriers with the EU are coming, something the Brexiters denied during the referendum, while in other global markets, Britain's current definition of success is replicating what it had in the EU.  It can be hard for rational analysts like Mr Eyal to fathom what was essentially a self-destructive act.  Brexit was about isolationism and prejudice. Brexit means diminished influence and has made a competitor of the EU, which strategically needs Brexit to fail.  So what was it for? A misconception of sovereignty, and to get free of EU labour and other laws that the British right, personified by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have long bridled at.  British politicians use the phrase "Singapore on Thames" to describe the low-tax, low-welfare country the British right lust for, yet which would most punish the very people in the north of England who voted for Brexit.  All sides in the British debate cynically misrepresent the reality of Singapore: high-quality public services and housing, things to which the current British government and Mr Raab in particular are ideologically opposed.
-1	Brexit will make it harder to fight future pandemics and reap the benefits of new clinical trials in the EU, Jeremy Hunt is warning.  The current proposals for the UK’s full divorce will have “a significant impact on health and social care”, a letter sent by the head of the Commons health committee states.  In particular, it criticises a failure to ensure the NHS can continue to obtain human parts for research or transplants, as well as cooperate on “pandemic management” and on the licensing of new medicines.  Joint working to protect imports of medical isotopes – used in the treatment of cancer – and on fighting antimicrobial resistance will also be “vital”, it warns.  The list has been drawn up as Boris Johnson resists pressure to extend the post-Brexit transition period, because of the coronavirus pandemic – risking a crash-out with no deal at the end of the year.
1	Hi, I am another German. I am very pro European integration. I would like something better than the EU but that's what we have to work with.  On one side I would like it, if the UK would be with us in this effort. For the talent and strength the UK could bring to the table, i am sad to see them leave.  On the other hand, experience has shown that the UK actively hindered further integration. The whole process of Brexit has shown, that even most remainers are only in it for their own benefits. That's why I am happy this unfortunate relationship is ending, and the rest of the EU can face the future without worrying about the family diva all the time.  And as final note: I as a rational person, believe in science. Part of that is experiments. If Brexiteers are right and I as a Pro-EU-Federalist am wrong. I want to see it. For that reason i am happy about Brexit. As it gives all sides the real world answer to what is better. With that in mind I am even prepared for the breakup of the EU in case of a Brexit success.
1	Brexit was predicted by major economists in the early 1990s.  They predicted that by eliminating the EU's economic borders, the Single Market would cause European countries to specialise.  Britain specialised in London's banking and financial services. Germany specialised in manufacturing, especially cars.  This was bad for Frankfurt, which is now a tiny financial centre compared to London.  And this was also very bad for Northern England, which lost its industries to Bavaria. UK manufacturing shrunk much faster in the Single Market era than it had under Margaret Thatcher.  This revealed to many voters the extent to which the EU-version of the British economy only worked for Londoners. They are now all very rich, because their houses have exploded in value over the past 30 years.  Hence Brexit, which was voted for by ex-manufacturing areas in the North.  I'm afraid that Germany is also now realising that its over-specialisation in manufacturing has been a huge error, just as was Britain's in banking. Competition from China, the trade war with the US, electric cars, Dieselgate and ever-tougher environmental laws are going to prove very difficult for Germany over the next 10 or even 20 years.  But Brexit could be good for Germany. Just as it will allow the UK to re-diversify, the same is also true of Germany. You should take your bankers back from London.
-1	Don't blame the immigrants, they do come to fill a gap on market, they do take jobs that no one else is willing to do anyway.  It's not a poor immigrants fault that incompetent governments or councils haven't invested enough into the housing and schools. Especially during a "good years" when the economy has been flourishing, underpinned by the influx of skilled workers from Eastern Europe after the 2004.  What's the worst outcome apart from economic stagnation and uncertainty -  The voices of bigoted, racist primitives became loud and confident. What they used to dare to say only in their living rooms, they can say on the street, in a bus or at work now. I witnessed it personally that before 2016 people have been much more careful not to be nasty to anyone, hiding it behind politeness. They've simply dropped all the pretence. No wonder, Murdoch's press have done an amazing job pitching hate and lies.
-1	Brexit will make regulatory compliance (with which I am concerned on a consultancy basis) much more complex – probably doubling my workload.
0	The Government previously warned that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights to and from the European Union could be delayed or cancelled. And there were fears that other travel to the continent – ferries, coaches and the Eurostar – could be disrupted too.  Now that a deal's been negotiated and a transition period agreed, everything should continue entirely as normal following Brexit Day.  In the longer term, there's uncertainty over whether the UK will be able to agree a trade deal this year with the EU. But even if it struggles to, with a more orderly Brexit now in motion it seems unlikely there'll be any travel disruption come 1 January 2021.
0	If you're a UK resident, you're usually eligible for a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). This entitles you to the same treatment at state-run hospitals and GPs that locals are entitled to, at the same cost, when travelling in the EU (plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and some overseas territories – see our Country-by-country EHIC guide).  You'll continue to be able to use your EHIC card for the rest of 2020, and apply for a new card or renew yours if needed.  However, after the transition period ends from 1 January 2021, the EHIC's future is less certain. The Government says it is discussing the future of reciprocal healthcare arrangements – including the future of the EHIC – with the EU.  The EU and UK have already agreed that some EHICs will remain valid after 2021 though:  UK pensioners living in the EU at the end of 2020 will be able to continue using their EHICs. UK students studying in the EU at the end of 2020 will also be able to continue using them. UK and EU nationals who find themselves in a 'cross-border situation' at the end of December 2020, ie, people who are on holiday in the EU over the new year, will be able to use their EHIC to access treatment until they return back to the UK.  Regardless of when you're travelling, it's important to check you have travel insurance that will cover you for medical costs.  In the meantime, there's no harm in making sure you have a valid EHIC – around five million expire each year, so it's easy to forget to renew. See our Free EHIC guide for full help.
-1	I think this is the biggest blunder in UK’s history for a very, very long time.  I used to see the United Kingdom as one of the pillars of Europe. A strong, dynamic country with a vibrant economy, a dynamic model of society and a reliable military partner as well. Like so many people, I was under the charm of the Brits.  It’s not just the Brexit that has changed all of that. But the Brexit vote showed another face of that country: a country that lives in self-delusion, pretending at greatness while being a small nation at the scale of the world, living in the nostalgia of the Second War where they beat the Germans and not realising that today’s Germany and UK are barely the same countries at all, dreaming itself as a global trading nation while at the same time cutting the links to the biggest market in the world, and maybe paving the way for a split-up of whatever was left of a formerly huge empire: the Scots are angry, Northern Ireland might see troubles again and Spain now has a veto on Gibraltar’s future.  I feel sorry for what was once a great nation. I feel sorry for those Britons who feel European and who are ejected from Europe against their will. I also feel sorry for the working class who voted Leave, believing (wrongly, as we can see now) this would give them back their NHS. I also feel sorry for the old generation who think they saved their country and condemned it. I also feel angry, sometimes, but anger is useless.  Now I wish good luck to the SNP, the Sinn Fein, Spain. I wish good luck to the Remainers. And maybe, in 20 years, an isolated ‘United Kingdom of England and Wales’ might change its mind. But even so, it will have been a sad thing to diminish this country and its history.
-1	I think we are on track to get pretty much the same deal we had before with Europe, but with no vote, influence or representation and at vast expense. The restrictions Leavers so complained of will still be there.  We have proved to the world that our narrow self-interest is more important to us than unity, or even peace in Europe.  I think the deal will impoverish Britain and our desperation to get trade agreements is set to fling us into the arms of very dubious politicians (like Trump) who will ruthlessly exploit our weakness.  We have greatly devalued our influence in the world. Brand Britain is not the force it was before this sad chain of events was put in gear, and the headlong pursuit of it in the face of all logic or prudence merely compounds the damage, as does our lack of clarity or preparedness for these complex negotiations.  We have put our futures, that of our children and grandchildren in the hands of deluded politicians uniquely ill-equipped to deal with their faith-based crusade. David Davis, Liam Fox, Ian Duncan-Smith, Michael Gove etc are utterly inadequate and are proving to be no match for the seasoned operators across the channel.
0	Brexit might be changing the course of British and European history but that hasn’t stopped Americans from taking an interest — and having a say.  President Donald Trump has been characteristically forthright, commenting on both the opportunity that leaving the 28-member union could bring to the U.K. and U.S.′ relationship, and also on how badly he thought British Prime Minister Theresa May had handled the negotiations.  Brexit faced a crucial week this week as May tried to get her Brexit deal approved by the U.K. Parliament. It failed to win enough support from British lawmakers for a second time but MPs also then voted to reject the option of leaving the EU without a deal. They are next going to vote on whether to delay Brexit altogether.
-1	I have been quite anglophile for some time, love British music, TV, film and literature. I was aware that the UK had very often its very own view on the EU - but I regarded it as some corrective.  The referendum was a huge disappointment.  It was not only the simple fact of the outcome but all the things which went with it. Are the Brits only afraid of the Syrian refugees or of the Polish nurses as well? Do they really think, that any important decision in Brussels would go against the explicit will of the British government? Do they really think, that the required bureaucracy when making business with dozens of countries is less than one big bureaucracy in Brussels?  I am no doomsayer, but I am convinced that all this was completely unnecessary. All problems could have been addressed within the EU. That would have been much easier than what the UK is facing now.  For me Great Britain just became a bit smaller.
-1	What do I think of Brexit? Well in the spirit of openness, I voted Remain. After looking at the facts that were available and the information provided by both camps, to me there was no other logical choice. However, slightly more people decided to vote Leave than Remain and so that's what is going to happen.  There were several key points put forward by the Leave campaign  Political accountability and representation. The EU does have issues in this area, that cannot be denied, however, so does Britain. We are currently ruled by a party that gained less than 40% of the vote, yet has an absolute majority in the commons. The same party tried to force through the triggering of Article 50 without reference to Parliament and then actively fought a legal case brought to make it adhere to British law. They are also trying to engineer a bypass of Parliament to re-write British law to deal with the split from the existing legal framework. Expects more high handed, undemocratic activity now that we have ‘taken our country back’.  Better trade deals. Whilst it may be possible to negotiate better deals with some nations, this is all conjecture at this point. What we definitely will not get is a better trade deal with the EU than we have today.  Immigration control. Yes, we will control immigration from the EU. That accounts for roughly 50% of immigration (according to Migration Watch UK | Statistics-net-migration-statistics  ). We still want the high value workers - they are needed because the UK does not have those skills. The workers who come to the UK for the lower paid jobs can possibly be excluded, but currently British workers are not willing to do those jobs for that pay. This means that either the jobs just will not be done or they will cost more in labour, raising prices.  There are also consequences that have generally been ignored by the Leave campaign.  The cost. Leaving the EU will cost the country a vast sum of money, even if we ignore the ‘divorce settlement’. Millions will need to be spent reorganising, updating laws, changing bits and pieces and renegotiating our position in the world. Even if the millions made famous from the big red bus were not an outright lie in the first place, it would be eaten for years just paying for the separation.  The loss of influence. By packing up our toys and going home we have thrown away a significant portion of our influence in Europe. We have handed the future of the EU to the Germans and the French who will be more than happy to build an economic super power sat 25 miles from our coast. Instead of being part of a significant power block, we will become increasingly irrelevant in a global world. Simple numbers dictate that Britain as a market will have less impact in a global world.  Globalisation is here to stay. You may not like it, but the impact of globalisation will continue. No one has brought forward any ideas yet on how we will turn back that tide. By ourselves we have less economic muscle and less ability to mitigate its impact. We are a small nation of just over 60 million people and the world does not owe us a living.  Brits abroad. British subjects in Europe have been all but abandoned. With some denied a vote in the referendum, these people have been religated to bargaining chips by a cynical government.  Internal division. Leave won the vote by less than 4%. Since then, the government has made absolutely no attempt to unite the country or to heal the divisions of a brutal, hate filled political campaign. What we have seen instead is yet more hatred and venom spat out by the right wing press and condescending comments from the more rabid Brexitiers.  Many reasons why. The Leave campaign was supported by a very broad church of people. Political groups from both the right and left supported the move, but for different reasons and with different desired long term outcomes. It take very little effort to imagine that some people will not get what they really wanted in the long run, even if they do get their goal of leaving the EU.
1	The EU is negotiating aggressively as though the UK was an ideological opponent. Perhaps in some ways we are. We believe in a democratically elected and accountable executive, something the EU is definitely not. We believe the accounts should be audited and accounted for. Something the EU isn’t concerned with. There’s always more where that came from!  The negotiations haven’t gone as well as most had hoped, with the exceptions of those who voted remain who are falling over themselves with joy. This is because as stated above. We will see if the millions of jobs dependent in both the UK and EU have any impact on the EU negotiator, but I doubt it. The millions of Greeks who suffered with the EU imposed austerity were not offered real help so the jobs will likely be lost on the altar of punishing the UK.
1	Brexit is wonderful. A layer of government is being removed. The EU has been a dampener on growth for the last half century, with the stagnation becoming more pronounced in the last decade. Now we have chance to engage with the modern world, unfettered by the EU's silly tariffs and mass of regulations - mostly in place due to systemic corruption at Brussels.
0	“I think people aren’t comfortable one way or another (with Brexit) and you’ve got the generational differences as well. So I think there needs to be more dialogue so that people understand both sides of the equation and then they can come to something that’s good for everyone involved,” Nina Ahuja, a Canadian tourist, told CNBC.
0	Despite other comments shown, I don’t think Britain has become a ‘laughing stock’ in Europe. I would say that most here have been shocked and disappointed by the vehemence unleashed against the EU.  We all have put up with the poisonous and repugnant behaviors of Farage and his then UKIP, now BREXIT MEP’s, but I think most thought this was simply the lunatic fringe of the UK scene, and didn’t represent the UK as a whole.  I really don’t think that any in Europe realised the depth of hate towards them - and I use the word ‘hate’ advisedly, because it cannot be described in any other way. Most recognise that not everyone in the UK feels this way, but the obvious fact as shown in elections and the referendum that more than half the UK voters have turned their backs on an association they have been part of for over 70 years has come as a shock.  In trying to follow the Brexit ‘debate’ we have seen the decline in the image of British politics than eve if we disagreed with them was at least at a polite level. The British pragmatism and politesse as it was seen, was respected.  The arrival of Farage and his minions changed all that, but most of Europe did not realise that he is the face of at least half of the UK. From then on it seems to have been a race to the bottom in British politics. The very language has changed to the lowest level. The EU has now been attacked surprisingly from the Right more than the Left, in what can only be described as ‘gutter language’ - and most surprisingly of by a man who is now your Prime Minister. ‘F**** Business’, and ‘Those French Turds’ are comments that are hardly likely to either make friends or enhance the image of the UK.
-1	The only people I know that supports Brexit as a good idea are the most nationalists (same people that supported ETA in their time), and a few marxists-anticapitalists (who in my country are the anti-EU faction, you know. In Spain the anti-EU are not alt-right, but alt-left. Duh).  For the rest, Brexit is:  Old and accommodate people robbing young and less fortunate people of their future. A surefire method to get a huge inflation (and boy, that is insanely bad in a country with such a huge real state bubble. That will be a case study for generations to come). A throwback to the romantic nationalism mentality that brought two world wars to Europe; luckily UK is way too weak (and will be a lot weaker) to, by itself and alone, make that kind of mess. And it brings the same spirit that David Lloyd George impersonated when, in 1936, hailed Hitler as the “greatest person of the world”.  From an outside perspective, Britain and its people have a huge potential. A huge potential to be a beacon of light and future to the world, one of the guides of modern civilization, or potential to become one of the darkest and grittiest places of earth, a menace for every civilized nation.  I only can think that Brexit is a huge step going to the latter: a Britain driven by fear, xenophobia and provincialism.  And that is the thing that worries me the most; not the economic factors.
0	I have 3 EU citizenships (one of them being British) and despite not being confident enough that I understand every aspect of EU politics, Brexit comes across as a huge cultural misjudgement borne out of arrogance and an inability to see anything other than the British perspective.  In my opinion, to understand the EU, you need to understand a lot about the various European cultures, their different histories and speaking their languages might help.  I feel no anger towards many Leave voters who simply thought that they were being patriotic, who simply had no way of knowing whether either vote would be better or worse for the country.  However there is definitely a group of arrogant Leave voters who think that they don’t need to understand anything about the EU to make a decision on Brexit. This arrogance is common in British society among a certain group of person that may be relatively smart, not university-educated but professionally successful but is likely to be ignorant of other cultures and languages, yet feels in no way that that is a setback for them to form an opinion. They will have very strong opinions on the EU and other countries despite never having had any real exposure to those countries other than the occasional holiday or trip. The rare Leaver who did spend some time abroad is unlikely to have ever tried to understand or learn the local culture: a case in point is Nigel Farage who does not even speak basic French, Flemish or German despite having worked in Brussels for close to 20 years and having a German wife. As much as such a person may not be academically gifted with languages, for me this shows a genuine lack of interest in learning languages and understanding other cultures.
-1	The UK was not a victim of Brussels bureaucrats, the UK was one of the pillars of that process and one of the main contributors for it’s success. Brexit (like other developments in other European nations or even the US) was a result of nationalism in motion, brought about mainly by fear and an insular mindset, which strikes us as odd, seeing that the UK was always a main engine for globalization, free-market, liberalism, promoting democratic standards and human rights all over the world. Brexit, in my view, is a retreat from that openness to the world, in favour of values like protectionism, populism and nationalism. It’s very sad, and an historical mistake, in my view.
-1	52% of Brits voted to leave. I don’t know how many of them changed their mind. So far there is no deal so there is nothing to think about. All I can say is that the more intelligent part of the UK voted to stay. Morons voted for Brexit. In the country of 15% of illiterate people (the highest rate in western world) any stupidity is possible. Idiots traded their future for fancy new blue passports. How nice and how British.
1	I am very happy. I do not want my country taken over and integrated into Europe. Previously I could accept the EU was necessary, but now it is a growing problem. At present food prices are higher, but otherwise things look much better for the future. I do not think the UK should pay 50 billion for a trade deal, it is simply blackmail and bullying.  I never felt like a European although like most I went along with it since it did not bother me too much and working together is good. However, in recent years (since Lisbon treaty) the EU has become a headache. With directly elected politicians we can get rid of them and the now whole concept of the EU needs rethinking.
1	Brexit, if implemented properly will be the best thing to happen to Britain for generations. We are escaping an emerging European superstate, which forced the French, Dutch and Irish to vote again because they rejected the Lisbon treaty. We can finally control our borders sensibly, and be able to sort out problems caused by open borders such as housing shortages and pressure on the NHS. We will stop paying money into the EU (and we are a net contributor so get less back currently).  We want the government to just get on with Brexit but we think the current government is not implementing the Brexit we voted for, paying a divorce bill which we don't have to pay when Brexit was about stopping paying money to the EU.
1	What the majority of us were thinking was that it made no sense to stay. Now that we are nearly 10 months after the historic vote to leave my opinion remains the same and if anything I am even more confident that it was the right move. I have always believed it was the right route to take and have great confidence in the UK’s ability to trade with a diverse variety of countries throughout the world.  Since the vote the stockmarket, housing market, employment and trade figures are all fine and there are strong indications of future inward investment. When you factor in also that it is becoming very clear we are going to negotiate favourable trade deals with countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, India and many countries that comprise the Commonwealth plus many others it becomes very clear that if the people of the country work hard and pull together and focus toward a common purpose we will have a great future freed from the shackles of the European Union.  Frankly nothing particularly negative has happened other than the drop in the value of the Pound but even that is coming back as time passes - frankly it’s a small price to pay when it means you regain control of your country and all future laws will be made in our own parliament by elected representatives and not a bunch of bureaucrats sitting in Brussels with their one size fits all mentality.
1	Immigration is not bad. Uncontrolled immigration is. I strongly believe immigration is super important, and can hold an economy together, and honestly foreign nurses have probably helped the NHS to not completely collapse. However, I believe that people should have to apply, and there should be systems in place to help them learn English and work here, not just leave them floundering. I also believe refugees need to be allowed into Britain, but that is a whole different issue.  On the subject of legislation and courts, I believe that the UK Supreme Court needs to be, well, supreme. It currently isn’t. And that to me isn’t right. The idea that Europe can overturn British decisions doesn’t quiet sit right with me - it’s our country not yours, and our people, not yours, so it’s none of your business. I also do not believe the EU should be able to pass laws that we have to follow - Europe is too diverse and full of too many different cultures for laws to fairly apply to everyone. I love the range of cultures I can visit, but just because a law works in one country doesn’t mean it will work here. British laws are for the British people to make.  Trading deals are another issue I have. The single market is amazing, and a great idea, but to me everything that comes with it is not worth it. Also, the UK cannot make deals with other countries without the whole EU.
1	I'm British, and I was thinking that the UK should not share the fate of the EU, which is institutionally corrupt, protectionist and incompetent. Absolutely no regrets. The EU has…  Fastest rate of decline of any major region or bloc.
1	I think you’re wrong, if there were another vote, more would vote to leave. I say this because since the referendum we have seen an even darker side to the EU and to the left generally. Very intolerant.  The thing is, people think that Brexit will be bad for the economy which is itself debatable. But the question isn’t about economics per se, it does not matter to the leave voter whether we will be richer or poorer.  The question is about democracy. The EU is objectively undemocratic and that is a fact. We, the majority who voted Leave, voted in this way to return Britain to it’s true democratic integrity.  Also, immigration is a hot topic, as the son of immigrants, and part of a family whom voted for Brexit, I can say that immigration while initially brilliant for Britain has become truly awful and a major strain on public services.  I couldn't care less what other European nations think about it, the fact is, 3/4 of the bloc benefit from it’s handouts (Eastern Europe as the most obvious example) where as 1/4 are the countries supplying these handouts. We don’t want to be giving aid to Romania and Poland while also accepting hundreds of thousands of them into the country to perform low-skilled work to only send that money back to their countries, it is absolutely ridiculous and finally, we voted against this.
-1	Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms "exit" the energy market, "exacerbating" the economic and political impact of Brexit.  The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which said the UK could be "more vulnerable to supply shortages in the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
-1	Also, U.K. companies could lose the ability to bid on public contracts in any EU country. These are open to bidders from any member country. The most significant loss to London is in services, especially banking.
-1	I think we are on course to make Britain inhospitable to many foreign workers who help our country function.  All this was predicted but dismissed. 'Ready for the next stage of humiliation' Nigel Farage has NO HOPE for Brexit trade talks.  The only difference is that I think this is a cue to abandon the shameful enterprise we should never have embarked on in the first place.
-1	Brexit would eliminate protections of equal pay, maternity leave, and safe workplaces.
-1	Brexit would change the perspective of Britain being the “gateway” to Europe.
-1	Brexit could create a labor shortage.
-1	Brexit could prevent the sharing of intelligence information.
-1	Brexit could reduce the amount of foreign direct investment that Britain receives.
-1	Brexit could still force Britain to be subject to EU laws and regulations.
-1	Brexit could reverse the protections of food, health, and animal rights.
-1	Brexit could force Brits living in EU member states to move back home.
-1	Brexit would create more high-skill job openings that would remain unfilled.
-1	Brexit could cause Britain to lose the U.S. as a primary trading partner.
-1	Brexit would end access to the regulation cost guarantees that Europe provides.
-1	Brexit could cause household energy bills to rise.
-1	Brexit may shift the educational diversity found in the country today.
-1	No tangible benefits - now or in the future except for the brigade who believe “sovereignty” grows on plants.
-1	Nie ma żadnych zalet dla Wielkiej Brytanii za opuszczenie UE, chyba że byłby to norweski brexit.
-1	Brexit is the most self-destructive thing a country could do.
-1	Brexiters are going to be crushed, fear (of the unknown) wins every single time, very few people will vote to leave when nobody knows exactly whats going to happen to the British economy or the sterling. Only a fool believes Brexit is possible.
-1	Brexit campaign are a bunch of liars. They keep making up that leaving the EU will save us a fortune. Well, it will not.
-1	The UK leaving the EU can only have positive effects for the EU and negative for the UK, and especially the UK citizens.
-1	The consequences of Brexit for Britain and the European Union would be absolutely dreadful. Worse than you can ever imagine.
-1	What people don't understand is Brexit won't diminish immigration, Britain will instead see an influx of migrants from the Commonwealth to counteract the migrant deficit of leaving the EU. On another note a scary number of acquaintances of mine are moving their business to the EU which means less jobs. The only true benefits of leaving that I see (and this is from substantial research) is cutting ties with the common fisheries policy for fisherman, oh and investing in the pound as it crumbles to rock bottom.
-1	The EU has integrated our growth and taken account of our foibles, even at the expense of their core mission; no single currency for us! Annual cashback? - No problem. The EU has given us new and larger markets to sell into on excellent terms; it has delivered the human, material, financial and regulatory capital to lock in the gains we have found.More than that, it has based some of its leading institutions in our country and helped subsidise the creation of some of our own centres of excellence - making our country a magnet for some of the brightest and best in their particular fields from all around the world.
-1	Countries around Europe have laws and regulation different from each other. this proved that laws are not designed in Brussels and applied to all member states. We still control our borders and EU immigration for years has been on par with non EU immigration. NON EU immigration is much more dangerous for UK way of life. We could simply have imposed higher taxation on non UK residents and immigration would have reduced.
-1	Definitely remain for all its faults the EU has brought peace, prosperity to Europe generally made it easier to travel, work, trade with countries closest to UK. Politically as moved Europe in a more liberal way, the cost of leaving will be more than staying in the EU were we had a say in the direction the organisation wished to go o trade agreement will make up for the one were about to lose, by the time we realise it will be to late.
-1	I'm against. Partly because I think it's best for the UK, both politically and economically, but I have to say mainly because the EU project is something I'm deeply sympathetic with. I have many friends all over Europe and I don't see any reason to drive a divide between "us" and "them" when the EU is all about fostering a real sense of community and solidarity, something which is unfortunately rather lacking in Tory Britain.
-1	Without being in the EU we're lonely old UK, out by ourselves. And with the inevitable loss of Scotland and their return to the EU we'll be even more isolated. The US doesn't care for the 'special relationship', the Commonwealth isn't really all that and Europe will shun us. Worse still we could end up like Norway - paying for all the things the EU gives them but with no say over it. It will hit business, either through lack of trade or because they relocate, and it will affect all those millions of British people in the rest of the EU.
-1	So let us look at the numbers. It is not just the UK Treasury that is predicting a dire outcome for the economy should the nation leave the EU. Investment banks, research houses, think tanks, central banks, and trade organisations all say the same.
-1	The major issue is that it will become a lot more expensive for Britain to ship out or bring in goods. This is because we will not have tariff-free access to EU markets under EU rules. That is just how it goes. If it does become more expensive for either party, this will hit sales and competition.
-1	45 per cent of the UK’s exports are to the EU, while 50 per cent of imports are from the EU. Membership of EU makes the UK more attractive for foreign investment The pro-EU camp say this access to the EU market balances out the £200billion cost of membership.
-1	EU protects the rights of employees.  Regulated working hours, capped at 48 hours per week.  Guarantee of 4 weeks annual leave. Parental leave guaranteed. Anti-discrimination protection.
-1	I’m concerned about the financial cost of Brexit and it’s impact on the UK’s standing in the world and the implications for the unity of the United Kingdom by its effect on Scottish independence and the Irish border.
-1	The EU has broadened and enhanced the opportunities for education (and subsequent employment) for our students. We have a space programme that we would never have had on our own - and, as a result, we are the creators of some of the best satellite technology in the world.
-1	The EU has helped us deal with some of the less glamorous stuff as well: we have some of the best employment conditions in the world. Workers are much safer than they were - as are consumers. Our environment is much cleaner and more protected than it otherwise might have been …fish are back in the Thames!
-1	"Within the EU we can trade with 500M people easily and without the risk of trade barriers or disputes.Within the EU we know what we buy and where it’s from. We can expect quality standards that will not be guaranteed by non EU countries. Brexit process was going to be long and difficult. Our politicians are in fact spending most of their time working on Brexit and ignoring the real issues. We simply don’t have a strategy to follow outside the EU."
0	Agreeing a UK-EU trade deal is a top priority, so extra charges on goods and other trade barriers aren't needed when the transition ends.  If any trade deals are reached, they won't be able to start until the transition period ends.
0	Leaving the EU will have important short term costs, no doubt.  In terms of labor mobility, being out of the EU is not as good as being in and there might be a few other issues, but by and large I am not sure that in the long term being "out" might be so bad for the UK....
0	Frankly I don't think the decision to stay with EU or not will trigger by itself huge problems for UK.
0	I'm a bit split on the whole thing, I hate the EU for a countless reasons and I think it needs MASSIVE reform and our own government is also pretty awful in its current state, even so I think we should be controlled by our own voted in government rather than being told what to do by other countries and an unelected European Commission. It makes our government accountable for their own decisions and doesn't allow them to use the EU as a scapegoat for every unfavourable law that gets passed like they have done so many times in the past.
0	I like the idea of Europe but worry the whole thing is skewed to favour the German economy and Luxembourg quangos. I think we were mainly in support of the Common Market but feel like I’m on a train which has passed my stop and I worry where its final destination is. A unified state or Army? So there we are, I’m totally impartial and I want to be convinced one way or the other.
0	Firstly, I think the whole issue of Brexit, is an impossible question. There are so many variables, so many pros and cons, and so many unknown quantities, that simply saying “yes” or “no” is laughable. Even if we all had a PhD in Economics and History and Geography and Politics and a few others! we would not be qualified to make a sound decision.
0	The sheer amount of ridiculous comments from both camps make it very hard to make any sort of informed decision. Brexit supporters do not have a crystal ball. EU supporters can't just plug their ears and pretend everything is going to be OK.
1	Sorry, I haven't been objective in the answer, but I think the main problem with EU is that economic issues always came first relatively to other significant ones.
1	Oh, and this week we are watching the EU try for slip through a clever power-grab. They want to UK to sign up to what they call “dynamic alignment” which would mean that whenever the EU changes its regulations, the UK would have to make the identical change in its, which would allow the EU to claim that the UK was independent, while keeping indirect control over UK law and being able to over-rule Parliament even in domestic cases involving UK markets, and UK production sold to UK consumers and going no-where near the EU.
1	I see the EU as becoming more of a risk to security than a guarantee of peace. It is also a failure as an economic block, with ambitions doomed to fail. Since the emergence of China, the USA has fallen behind, and the EU has little relevance on the world stage since all people see are its problems.
1	We on the leave side are more passionate about leaving the EU than ever, and the majority of remainers are decent democratic people who accept the result and want the government to get on with it too.
1	We have seen the disastrous problems that this rigidity in Brussels has caused in the countries of Southern Europe, as I see it voting to leave when we did was the most sensible option considering the alternative was staying on board what is effectively a sinking ship with an ever decreasing percentage of world trade.
1	Brexit was the best move we could have made and although we were the first to leave we will in all probability not be the last.
1	I want to leave the EU so Britain can rule Britain again, but I don’t want to leave Europe - I believe the UK and Europe should have a close relationship and work together, because honestly, that is just better for everyone.
1	The EU will be the death of itself. France, the Netherlands and eventually Germany will realise that it is not in their best interests to support developing European economies and hopefully the whole thing will disintegrate. Which is better for the individual states and their identities.
1	Britain is by far the strongest country in Europe, historically, economically and in many other ways, and we will NOT be pushed around by the Fourth Reich any longer!  Also, 3 million EU nationals came to Britain, only 1 million Britons moved to the continent. Quite frankly that goes to show what a messed up system the EU is.
1	Brexit may help the country experience immediate cost savings.
1	Brexit would shift the emphasis of trade for Britain.
1	Brexit establishes the sovereignty of Britain.
1	Brexit would reduce the issues with forced immigration associated with the EU.
1	Brexit offers the possibility of new jobs.
1	Brexit could improve border security.
1	Brexit could help to stop issues with bureaucracy.
1	Brexit would create additional savings opportunities worth considering.
1	Getting out of the EU is the sensible thing to do for any country that values its sovereignty.
1	Imprisonment and infringement of freaking socialists structure - EU must be dismantled. Bye bye Union . Welcome to free trade.
1	Please vote leave, Brits! We need to end globalism!
1	Once you realize that the EU is an economic basket case, it is hard to think of any reasons for staying in - apart from (perhaps) not needing your passport so much.
1	Amazing how many people who live outside the UK who want us to stay in, easy when you don't have to live with the consequences.
1	I believe democratic independent nation states with a common language and shared culture deliver the best outcomes for their citizens.  I would rather we had friendship and dialogue, did business free of tariffs and quotas, but kept our local democracies and identities. The EU is inching towards becoming a federal superstate, which is the polar opposite of what I want for my country.
1	The EU is performing poorly as a trading block. It has deeply protectionist policies baked into the core of its thinking. It does bad deals and takes forever to do them — it looks inwards within the 28 members most of the time.  Belonging to the EU is hampering the UK from strengthening collaborations with the Commonwealth, investing in emerging technology and competing in the global marketplace. Leaving will undoubtedly cause some pain, but I think it will be better in the long term.
1	The EU is wastefully bureaucratic in the extreme and bad value for money. It has 10,000 civil servants paid more than our Prime Minister. We have to contribute £2.30 for every £1 we get back in EU projects.
1	I have always been pro European but the swarm of Islamic hatred pouring into the UK has to be stopped. Islam is incompatible with modern civilised society and we have to control our borders. If the EU don't also see this then it makes sense for us to leave and decide for ourselves who we let in. It's a shame that the European experiment was doing so well and religious faith had to poison it all.
1	We are one of the top three net contributors to the EU budget, meaning we get less from it than we put in. What's more, the better our economy does, the more we are expected to contribute, despite the EU trying to impose measures that damage our biggest industries such as the Financial Transaction Tax. We're even expected to contribute to things that have nothing to do with us, such as Greece's third bailout.
1	I think our current level of 300,000 net immigration per year is completely unsustainable for jobs, public services, housing, culture and integration, and getting out of the EU is the only way to bring this down.
1	Some estimates suggest the total economic cost of EU membership is over 10% of our annual GDP, circa which makes it something like £200 billion. This money would be better spent on new British industry and Retail and Development.
1	The UK has no control over immigration from other EU member states.Immigrants exploit health system and are benefits‘ tourists. The UK is a place where people visit or migrate because of what they perceive as a more generous welfare system, or the NHS. Belief that the UK is at greater risk of a terror attack while part of the EU.
1	Brexit by the end of the year will protect UK from Eurozone financial crisis, senior Brexiteers say.
1	Speaking as they launched a new, cross-party think tank, Owen Paterson, the former Tory cabinet minister, and John Longworth, the ex Brexit Party MEP, claimed that Britain would be in a stronger position to recover from a slump if the Brexit transition period ends on schedule, at the end of December.
0	It's been more than three years since the UK voted to leave the European Union but now it's about to happen. Through two changes of prime minister, two general elections, and more votes in parliament than anyone cares to remember, here's a quick recap of how we got here.
-1	Brexiteers’ delusional as always.  Their monomaniacal obsession just makes them look out of touch, selfish and uncaring. With many sectors on their knees, neither the UK or the EU in any position to negotiate anything meaningful their obsession risks the whole thing being unwound.
0	THE EU IS SET TO BEGIN video-based accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia. German politician Michael Roth wrote on Twitter! So what's the problem with negotiating Brexit by Video?
1	We were never an ideal fit in the EU. It could have worked if it had remained a simple trading relationship but it didn’t and , despite our own politicians assurances, it was always intended to create a European State. Everybody lied to us beginning with Ted Heath and followed by John Major and Tony Blair. Thank God our wonderful electorate rebelled and got us out.
1	I see the establishment are already looking to topple Boris Johnson over COVID 19 and then push through remain in all but name. No!
-1	Brexit coronoidiots. New Brexit species emerging. By the way food supply chains still working thanks to the transition period. Otherwise apart from loo papers the fresh food from SM shelves would be empty too.
1	"We did not defeat the German enemy 75 years ago by dwelling whether to hang around; no, we for on with our own interests and stuck it on them."
-1	Absolutely nothing short of disgraceful when they know full well that had the UK remained a member of the EU then the war against the Covid-19 virus would have been better managed.
1	Yes, we have to get out. If Brussels changes the rules during the transition we can do nothing about it. All it wants is that shower to vote for shared debt regardless of currency and the UK will be in trouble.
-1	The UK has become disinterested in Europe and will now have to think of itself in a world of mass debt and depression which will mean being ruthless to claw lost money back.
1	"They are starting to fall apart now they are showing what they really are ""money collectors"". Walk away before they bankrupt us."
0	Like in Scotland, most people in Northern Ireland voted against leaving the European Union. The 2016 referendum was ultimately carried by pro-Brexit votes in England and Wales.
0	Roughly three quarter of the UK membership fee was returned to the UK for specific programs. The part of the membership fee that has to be compensated by the EU27 is only one quart of the total UK membership fee. If necessary, the EU can downgrade or suspend easily selected programs. The EU has no serious budget problem.
1	We need to leave ASAP. No doubt they'll want us to bail out all the other countries. The German finance minister already killed himself. And many speculate its because he knew the Eurozone will not survive this.
-1	Nonsense from an ignorant little Englander. UK will lose everything after Brexit.
0	In reality Johnson has made only as much progress as did his predecessor, Theresa May, who also signed a withdrawal agreement with the E.U.
0	The prime minister needs to convince more than half the 650 lawmakers of the House of Commons to back his plan. If they don't, by law he will have to write to the E.U. to ask for another extension — which would be the fourth time the U.K has asked for more time since the Brexit referendum in 2016.
1	There are a lot of media buffoons who don’t understand the difference between left and leaving. This guy was one of them. We got Brexit done and won with a thumping majority.
-1	Cottage industry started in Cornwall to sew scrubs for medical/care staff. At end of this must be an investigation how 6th richest nation,which had months of notice,had no PPE or basic clothes for key workers. Heads stuck up their Brexit arses? Opposition needs to take blame too.
-1	Thank God we are still part of Europe. Stop Brexit!
1	Well there we have it no messing Sir Keir Starmer wants to extend Brexit talks deadline !!! Here starts his doomed campaign to keep us in the EU !!!
-1	However, whereas May's plan included a safety net if negotiations failed, Johnson's plan has no such provision.
-1	"The short version is that Brexit risks creating a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland, a part of the U.K, and the Irish Republic, a separate country that will remain part of the E.U. after Brexit. The worry is that a border would see the return to the sectarian violence that plagued Ireland for 30 years."
-1	"Where are all the Islamophobes now? What about anti-immigration Brexiteers? Are you still 100% that you don't want these ""foreigners"" taking British jobs?"
-1	The UK Govt is failing Scotland. Thankfully the Scots Govt & our amazing Health Advisers & NHS staff have been keeping us safe. It's time to change as soon as this tragedy is finished. So many lies told, so many people misled.
0	The UK has 9 months left to negotiate a EU trade deal. During this transition period the UK remains in the EU Customs Union & Single Market, as a rule taker, without ability to influence the rules. The new (self-imposed) 'cliff edge' is 31 Dec 2020.
-1	Of course I hate Brexit since it is a very bad idea for the UK. But please do not insult my integrity or intelligence. People are dying. NHS have no PPE. It is all very sad. I can’t stay silent in the face of such gross negligence on a scale unseen before.
0	The underlying trade balance moved into surplus in the latest three months, the first seen since comparable records began over 20 years ago. This surplus was caused by a large fall in goods imported from EU countries.
0	The BREXIT will have an impact on the economy of the member countries in Europe and an impact on firms.
-1	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU.
0	It will impact not only UK  and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
-1	Because of global technology, economy and problems, we need global cooperation and coordination.  Local chauvinism is NEVER an acceptable response!
-1	I still think that all countries of the world should be open to and trade with all countries for the benefit and prosperity of all.
0	There will surely be problems but not insurmountable. This process will continue if there is not a proper integration and a social Europe.
-1	There will surely be problems but not insurmountable. This process will continue if there is not a proper integration and a social Europe.
0	The Brexit campaign won an in-out referendum of EU membership which took place on June 23, 2016.
-1	The final nail in the coffin for a country which once was the “greatest” empire on earth.
-1	A Brexit in it's current form will destroy all of that. The largest tax revenue source is the financial industry. This will falter and diminish over time.
-1	A Brexit can only be saved in the short term by printing more money. Have we not learned anything over these last few years since the last economic meltdown?
0	Choose wisely, look up your constituents. Check who backs Brexit and who doesn't. For whoever you hold dear, vote. Even drawing a dick with balls on the ballot is better than to not vote at all.
-1	I underestimated the political impact. Brexit is now a political disaster.
1	I think the sooner we are out of the EU the better.
1	I am now absolutely certain that the UK must leave as soon as possible.
1	From those Brexiteers I speak with they appear to be pretty angry now. If we are denied Brexit again I very much fear we will start to see violence.
1	Because I believe in democracy and I want the people I vote for to have power over what happens in our country I voted ‘leave’ in the 2016 referendum.
1	So, I personally am very happy that we voted to leave the EU and am glad that we may now be able regain control over our future.
1	1 In my opinion the EU is a failed attempt to form an EU superstate and I personally do not want to be part of such an undemocratic experiment.
-1	Do I support Brexit? No.
-1	Therefore my assessment is Brexit is unlikely to deliver any economic gains, and there is a high risk of an economic downside then I have to consider if there are any obvious non-economic benefits.
0	Brexit is simple and harmless. It’s a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer’s no. It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren’t in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
1	Like in any toxic relationship, at some point it is time to just let them go. You can't live in such unhealthy relationship forever, made of blackmail, threats, whims.
1	If it comes to a Brexit it will be sad like in any divorce, we're gonna miss our little America, but let's be honest, the UK will still be part of the EEA, and the business will still keep going as usual, at least for the other side.
1	Brexit will be the best thing that happened to the UK for decades, in fact since we joined the club. \
-1	The short answer is that I did not support Brexit during the referendum. However, I believe in democracy so we must accept the result and implement Brexit.
0	In conclusion I view Brexit quite flexibly.
1	There was a period of time when I could say I was a supporter of Brexit, though at the time Brexit wasn’t what it is today and even the term Brexit hadn’t caught on.
1	I was actually excited by the possibility of leave the EU.
1	It’s a great idea makes total sense.
1	Exiting the EU is a shockingly stupid, ill-considered, self-destructive proposal. I support it 100%.
1	I am in favour of Britain exiting the EU. And no, I am not a crazy, raving “nationalist” (that would be ironic, as I am an Indian).
0	I think that there will be surprisingly little difference between staying in and leaving the EU. I very much doubt if those people from other EU countries already living and/or working in the UK will be chucked out, simply because there are many UK citizens living and/or working in other EU countries.
1	I think it is a step forward for the UK as long as its done well, and no, I'm not even a crazy fascist.
-1	My honest opinion is that Brexit is a catastrophe of the first order, which has been driven by hate, ignorance and lies.
-1	I think Brexit will mark the beginning of economic decline for UK.
0	There may well be pros and cons of leaving the EU, though the very act of leaving might be considered a sign of English xenophobia and arrogance towards a group of good partners in the past. But that may be construed as an opinion on another issue.
1	In my opinion, Brexit is a good decision on behalf of the UK. It’ll have the opportunity to grow without any dictation from the EU. It is considered one of the major benefits that the UK will have - the liberty in its affairs.
-1	In principle, I am a remainer, and do not support the UK leaving the European Union. If it were up to me, the UK would remain in a reformed EU.
-1	If we leave the EU it will be a mistake of monumental proportions.
1	The EU is a failure because it is even more corrupt than a mob boss. Everything it does is to make sure lit destroys true Europe, which has many cultures that have never once needed to be part of a Union to survive.
-1	In my opinion it is one of the single most stupid decisions taken by a democratic process (It was the most stupid until November 2016 and a certain vote in the USA - and it may get relegated again deepening on the outcome of the UK General election).
1	Brexit is the greatest opportunity this country will ever have! If handled right by our politicians (which is a totally different question), the UK will once more join the ranks of the other democratic nations of the world, able to make its own rules and laws without interference from an unelected and unaccountable organisation, enter trade deals on its own behalf, and once more be able to control its borders.
1	I am a supporter of democracy so would be hypocritical if I didn't support Brexit.
-1	It was a bad idea and I wholeheartedly support the idea of a second referendum.
-1	It is a catastrophe: economically, politically, socially.
-1	It’s wasteful, expensive, divisive and pointless. It’ll not fix any of the issues people think it would, however it’ll create many new ones.
-1	Brexit has caused more damage to the UK than just about anything else in the last century.
-1	It has the potential to be wholesale national suicide. Absolute best case, everything goes right in a way it never has before, we are still talking the economy dropping a few percentage points.
1	The way Europe is being run and its’ open borders policy, the sooner we leave the EU the better.
0	Mixed feelings. Disappointed to see them go as we are all neighbours and felt closer being in the EU together. But on the other hand, they didn't fully commit to the EU and always dragged their heals a bit. Refused to use the Euro and vetoed EU Army etc.
-1	No. It is a ridiculous notion. The UK, especially a broken and divided UK is too small to prevail in this time. We should by now have moved past national tribalism and embraced a larger the concept of a United Europe. I understand that some find this difficult, but it is the future. The alternative is constant division, petty squabbles and conflict.
-1	Brexit will be incredibly damaging to the economic future of our country and has to be stopped before it goes too far.
1	My personal view, is that we have made the right decision. The EU has turned out to be something no country ( although the EU refers to them as “ states”,rather than “countries”, ) would actually want.\
1	I support any and all nations that strive to leave the EU organisations. There are many that should be leaving prior to the UK, but if the UK is able to show the way, all well and good.
-1	"We need to stay close to Europe, not cast ourselves adrift. United we stand etc. The problem is that a section of the population, mainly English, believe naively, that they can recreate the""Merrie England"" of yesteryear that never existed for the majority."
-1	It’s mistake of UK and partly EU because EU is the greatest international project in the human history.
1	It’s about time. This has dragged on so long that I honestly thought the damn thing would get delayed again at 22:50. Now we can start getting to work on undoing the damage that the EU has been doing to us for so long, and prove to the world that Brexit was a good idea, for us at least.
-1	No I think this is a mistake ,and there is no logic in it ,No one I spoke about this process could not convince me that was a good idea their arguments did not add up.
-1	"It's a terrible idea. Once we had an empire to provide the resources we wanted; then we had the EU; now we're going to have neither."
1	True, there will be some negatives from leaving, both what we would loose, and what will happen. But I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives.
-1	The latest Survation poll confirms that public opinion has moved away from Brexit since the summer.
0	There are a range of opinions on Brexit, obvious by reading any social media. At the EU Referendum in the UK (June 2016), the electorate was fairly evenly split between the UK staying in the EU or leaving.
-1	I voted to remain in the EU. Although the EU is not perfect, I think that overall the EU has been a force for good.
0	Complex events can go either way, be successful or unsuccessful but rest assured that for complex event to be successful we need a lot of hard work, the right strategy and the right people.
-1	As self destructive acts of harm goes it undoubtedly ranks as possibly one of the worst decisions made by a western nation state in the last 50 years .
-1	It won’t improve the lives of those who need the hoped for boost - it will make their lives much worse.
-1	Please stop Brexit. Stop the circus, the protests, the downright frustration and despair. Stop the hours, weeks, months and years of wasted time and hundreds of thousands of millions of pounds that could’ve been put to SO much better use. PLEASE.
1	Despite the unending moaning and groaning and repetitions of the flawed claims by remain prior to us deciding to leave, we will be far better off out than in, if Cameron achieved one thing in his premiership it was to convince the British people that the EU can not be altered and will continue to go down the route the 28 unelected commissioners decide it will.
-1	The UK leaving the EU is comparable to that of handing a working car to a six year old.
1	The people of the United Kingdom voted for independence from the European Union - and that is what we want.
0	"At the time I thought the arguments for both sides seemed evenly balanced including the ideas that we could be freer to trade outside the EU, and freer to have “free movement of people” agreements with non-EU countries; I therefore abstained from voting."
1	It is hard to understand those who have such a poor impression of their country that they believe we need to be controlled by a foreign power.
1	I'm appreciative of Brexit. It's opened my eyes to many things that I may otherwise have been blind to. It's been a great exercise for my mind. Had the vote gone the other way it's highly unlikely imo that that result would have offered such rich contemplation.
-1	If the UK loses full access to the EU single market it will result in a lot of service businesses relocating jobs and tax revenues to the EU.
-1	Instead of pursuing an ideologically driven Tory Brexit and costing us £120 Billion or more, maybe  Boris Johnson should have invested that in the NHS.
-1	While Germany were making preparations for Corona in January, Brexit Johnson and the Conservatives were minting ceremonial Brexit Coins, printing blue passports and bonging BigBen. Deaths in UK are really a question of priorities.
-1	Just remember while you’re sat at home, wondering whether there is toilet roll or flour in the shops... UK govt is planning a real New Year treat for you. Hard Brexit with further shortages, three months of chaos at the ports and more economic bad news.
0	For me it is freedom of choice. But they must only claim benefits from one country and pay tax to the country where they reside. No two homes.
1	Only the EU could take so much time to make a simple decision. Free trade like the original common market. Bring Government back home. That it simple.
0	It was generally known that UK economy was going to suffer as a consequence of Brexit. Now Covid-19 can be put forward as an explanation by the Brexiteers why the advantages and profits they claimed Brexit would bring, are not going to be realised.
1	The good ship EU is sinking like the Titanic and we are very fortunate that we have left before we sank with it. Whatever the future holds I think we're in a better position having left the rotten, corrupt EU.
1	Good point - can you imagine if Remainers like you had not spent the last almost 4 years fighting democracy and Brexit, the govt might have been able to get on with the domestic agenda of properly equipping said same doctors and nurses.
-1	This is why the UK is a complete disaster. Heading to be the worst in the world in COVID. Complete destruction of the economy & everything established since WW2. Floundering in a crisis. But lets just add Brexit Every one of these creatures has an escape route. What's yours?
-1	Johnson has rightly praised the two immigrant nurses who stood by his bedside for 48 hours at the height of his coronavirus illness. Remember how the far right Brexit racists and little Englanders conducted themselves in 2016, well here’s a reminder!
-1	It is still a tragedy that the UK has been forced out of the EU. It is already suffering many negative consequences but the Brexit-supporting fanatics are unable to see them. The UK needs to come to its senses, realign towards the rest of Europe and rejoin the EU asap.
-1	British entity has lost a continent. Europe has lost only 1 GB.
1	UK does not need to trade, you see its the french that want to take over our fisheries, agriculture borders etc. Well EU, we are signing deals throughout the world. By the end of the year if EU is still trying to steal what is rightfully British. We walk away with a no deal. This will effect EU more than the UK as we have signed other deals with the rest of the world. Whilst EU will suffer for loss of trade.
0	England has enough immigrants.
1	Leave supporters are unyielding in their resolve that the referendum result is final, and that the UK must now leave the EU. However, while some on the leave side advocate a hard Brexit – gaining more sovereignty, taking control over immigration and reducing red tape – others are more moderate.
1	EU membership limits Britain’s international influence, ruling out an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
1	Britain contributes billions of pounds in membership fees to the EU every year.
0	There are two ways that Britain can leave the EU: with a deal, or without a deal. A scenario in which Britain leaves with a deal is sometimes referred to as a ‘soft Brexit’, and a scenario in which Britain leaves without a deal is known as a ‘hard Brexit’.
1	The average person in Britain loses hundreds of pounds each year due to EU VAT contributions and agricultural subsidies policies.
1	The EU subjects Britain to slow and inflexible bureaucracy, making it more prohibitive for smaller companies to do business.
1	Britain would have more control of its laws and regulations, without risk of having counterintuitive policies forcefully imposed.
-1	EU membership gives Britain access to the European single market, which is invaluable for trade and enables the easy movement of goods, services and people across member states.
1	Under EU law, Britain could not prevent a citizen of another member state from coming to live in the UK, and Britons benefited from an equivalent right to live and work anywhere else in the bloc. The result was a huge increase in immigration into Britain, particularly from eastern and southern Europe.
0	Take immigration, for example. Fewer people coming to the country would mean less competition for jobs among those who remained and, potentially, higher wages - a point conceded by Stuart Rose, leader of the pro-Remain Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. “But that is not necessarily a good thing,” Rose said, as labour shortages and rising wage bills could reduce economic competitiveness and growth.
0	It remains unclear how Brexit will affect the jobs market. Economic growth has slowed since the referendum, but employment remains high - and what happens next will depend largely on what sort of trading relationship the UK seeks with the EU and the rest of the world, and what they say in response.
1	The decision to leave the EU was the right one, which doesn’t necessarily mean everyone’s reasons for voting that way, were right. Some voted through fear of foreigners, some voted through nostalgia, some voted to give the establishment a kick in the teeth. All bad reasons.
1	There’s complete control of our borders, even that between Ireland and Northern Ireland, so we can keep all the foreign scroungers out.
1	Britain will gain the satisfaction of humbling Germany, who will be so distraught at the prospect of tariffs on cars that they will agree to anything. We will gain enormous satisfaction watching the EU collapse. How can it survive without us?
0	The EU has been a club. Like all clubs, members get benefits, but also have to abide by the rules.
0	The European Union is currently a conglomerate of 28 member states. In exchange for a membership fee, each member state enjoys the benefits of free and easy access across the region for goods, services, capital and people, the rules and vision of which are set out in the Treaty of Rome.
0	All 28 member states must abide by certain rules and regulations, all of which is overseen, underpinned and enforced by the European Court of Justice.
0	Nobody yet knows whether Brexit will be good for the UK or not, and those that claim certain knowledge one way or the other can presumably recite this week’s winning lottery numbers as well. If they cannot then their soothsaying prowess should be viewed with ridicule.
0	There are no real benefits at all(EU and UK) in Brexit, just illusory ones.
0	Most people agree that the EU and its predecessors have contributed to the prosperity that Europe is experiencing today. In almost all EU countries there is a consensus that we are stronger together. All around the world it can be observed that countries and regions cooperate, with positive results. Sometimes it is just a trade treaty, sometimes it goes much further. Also in the business world we see that companies merge in order to become more competitive and make more profit.
0	I just returned from a business trip back to UK. I get the strong feeling that ultimately Brexit is about immigration. There's a lot of people who are worried that Britain's infrastructure simply can't cope any more.
0	Norway and Switzerland are the only Western European countries that stayed out of the EU, and they prosper. But both countries had a special reason to stay out in the first place. Norway because of its vast oil and gas supplies, and Switzerland because it did not want to give up its special bank laws.
0	Most of the answers don’t make any attempt to give a balanced answer. Indicative of the divisiveness of the issue.
0	With Brexit you will have, inevitably less immigration and a smaller labor pool. Labor prices will go up. Costs for delivery of goods, manufacturing, services, will increase. This is assuming that economic output stays at the same level. Already we are seeing a very tight labor market because the influx of immigrants is drying up.
-1	We don’t gain anything economically from leaving. It’s that simple. There are no economic or trade benefits that we can avail ourselves of which offset the negative impact of leaving.
1	"Freedom! In just one word! Britain as a Nation had already established itself as a leading proponent for many of the aims behind ""some"" of the EU's objectives!"
1	Allows us to set our own tariffs, making food, clothes and shoes, cheaper.
0	Different people have different views on whether the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa.
0	A neutral, unbiased list of the pros and cons of Brexit is exactly the same as a raging partisan, clearly-biased list of the pros and cons of Brexit, if one is basing one’s decisions on objective measurable truth.
1	The ability to make direct trade deals with parts of the world that are growing instead of having to focus on the declining region of the EU. A sense of control of our destiny instead of it being in the hands of appointed officials in another country making laws which supersede our own national ones. With the second point, I have to say I have some misgivings considering the shambles the UK parliament has made of leaving the EU but at least I can go and see my local MP next week and tell him what I think. I can't do that with anyone in Europe. Their form of governance is way too remote from the people to be called “democratic”
0	Leaving or joining the European Union is a decision that reflects your personal beliefs.
